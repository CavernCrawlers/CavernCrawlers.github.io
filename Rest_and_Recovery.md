# Rest and Recovery
There are three types of rest in this system: [Short](#short%20rest), [Long](#long%20rest) and [Extended](#extended%20rest).

## Short Rest
A **short rest** is a 10-minute breather after which a character may regain a few hit points. At the end of a **Short rest**, a character regains a number of hit points equal to the roll of 1 hit die plus their Constitution *Modifier*. A character cannot benefit from more Short Rests in a 24 hour period than their Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).

## Long Rest
A long rest is at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep or light activity. At the end of a **long rest**, a character heals back a number of hit points equal to 1 hit die plus their Constitution *Score*. This total may be further modified if they are under [Medical Care](#medical%20care). Additionally, a character maintaining a Wealthy or higher [lifestyle](EncumbranceAndEqupment.md#lifestyle%20expenses) adds a second hit die to the amount of hit points regained.

*For example, Merrick is a 5th level Fighter with a 16 Constitution. At the end of a short rest, he can regain 1d6 + 4 hit points (1d6+2 for his hit die plus another 2 for his constitution modifier). At the end of a Long Rest with a superior quality meal while staying in a superior quality room at an inn, he’ll regain 2d6+4 (2 hit dice because of the wealthy lifestyle) + 16 (constitution score) hit points.*

Any characters completing a **Long Rest** will recover one rank of [Exhaustion](Conditions.md#exhaustion). When their exhaustion rank reaches 0, they are no longer Exhausted.

If a character has any [Lingering Injuries](Combat.md#lingering%20injuries), they may be allowed a chance to recover from those injuries after a **Long Rest**.

If a **Long Rest** is interrupted, but at least 10 minutes of rest has been achieved, the characters will at least gain the benefits of a [Short Rest](#short%20rest).

A character cannot benefit from more than 1 Long Rest in a 24 hour period.

## Extended Rest
An **Extended Rest** requires a full week’s rest at a [Safe Haven](#safe%20haven).  At the end of an Extended Rest a character regains all Hit Points, recovers all ranks of [Exhaustion](Conditions.md#exhaustion) and has advantage on any rolls to recover from [Lingering Injuries](Combat.md#lingering%20injuries).

No other [Downtime Activities](Downtime.md) can be taken during an **Extended Rest**; your character is taking a week off to rest and recuperate.

If an **Extended Rest** is interrupted, but the character has managed at least a full 8 hours of rest, they will gain the benefits of a [Long Rest](#long%20rest).

## Safe Haven
A **Safe Haven** is defined as any location where characters can rest with no fear of danger nor any need to set up a watch. Typically this is a friendly town, keep or the like where the characters have access to good food and warm beds. The GM will let the players know when their characters have encountered a Safe Haven.

## Medical Care
If a character is under the care of someone with the [Healing](Skills.md#healing) skill, their recovery will be improved. After a [Long Rest](#long%20rest) under care of a healer, the patient will add the healer's Healing Skill bonus to the amount of hit points recovered. Additionally, they may add their caretaker’s Healing skill bonus to any checks they make to recover from [Lingering Injuries](Combat.md#lingering%20injuries).
