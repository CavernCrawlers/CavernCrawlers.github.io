# Shining Swords and Singing Spears
## Time
Time in combat (and other action scenes) is tracked in relatively strict and discrete game units called **Combat Turns**, **Rounds** and **Minutes**.

A **Combat Turn** is an individual creature’s opportunity to act.  All creature’s Combat Turns are executed in descending order of **Initiative** with tied Initiative results acting simultaneously.

A **Round** is the collection of all the Combat Turns of all the creature’s involved in the scene.  This takes up approximately 6 seconds.

A **Minute** is just that, one minute.  A minute is made up of 10 Rounds.
## Surprise
The potential for surprise exists when one side is aware and the other is not; allowing the aware side to attempt an ambush.  If both sides are unaware, they simply stand and stare at each other for a **round** while they both recover from surprise.  Both sides make a group **Wisdom/Perception** check vs a DT of 10.  During the first round of combat (known as the **Surprise Round**), those who passed their perception check take their **Combat Turns** as normal.  Those who failed their perception do not get to act during the Surprise Round.

### Ambush
If one side has advance warning of an encounter, they may attempt an **Ambush**.  In this case, the ambushing group rolls a Dexterity/Stealth check using the character with the worst modifier (counting **Disadvantage** as -4 and **Advantage** as +4).  This sets the DT of the **Wisdom/Perception** check of the unaware side.  During the **Surprise Round**, all of the ambushers can act as normal as can any of the opposition who pass their perception check. An ambush may also provoke a Moral check for undisciplined targets if the GM so determines.

After the **Surprise Round**, subsequent **Rounds** proceed as normal.

## Actions
There are four categories of action that may be taken during a creature’s **Combat Turn**: **Main Action**, **Movement Action**, **Free Action** and **Reaction**.

### Main Actions
Main Actions are those that will take up a majority of a creature’s time and attention during a turn.  This includes such actions as Attacking, Casting, most ability checks, applying first aid and other such complex or lengthy endeavors.  Each participant gets one Main Action on their Turn.

Following is a list of commonly used Main Actions.  This is not a complete list, just those that come up frequently during action scenes.
- **Attack:** Make one melee or ranged attack with a weapon or multiple attacks if you have a feature allowing you more than one attack per attack action.
- **Cast:**  Cast a cantrip or spell.  (Some may be cast as reactions.)
- **Command:** The character chooses to make themselves conspicuous to the enemy and give direction to their comrades.  The commander makes a DT 10 **Charisma** check and on a success, all allies that can see and hear the commander gain +2 to hit until the start of the commander’s next Combat Turn.  Character’s may only benefit from one instance of the Command action at a time.  While giving commands, the character is distracted and anyone attacking the commanding character does so with **Advantage**.
- **Dash:** Take an extra move action.
- **Defend:**  A Defending character gains +2 to **AC** and **Evasion** saving throws until the start of their next Combat Turn.
- **Escape:**  Escape a grapple by winning an opposed **Strength** or **Dexterity** check against the grappler’s **Strength** or **Dexterity**.
- **Help:** Assist another creature in performing an action.  If the action aligns with your **Class** or **Background** the acting creature gains +2 to their action.  If the action doesn't align with your class or background, you can still Help if the action is in service to one of your **Passions**, but you must pay 1 **Fortune Point** to render assistance.
- **Prepare:**  Choose a **Main Action** you will take in response to a set trigger.  Taking the triggered action uses up your **Reaction**.  Preparing a spell or cantrip requires **Concentration**.
- **Protect:** Choose an adjacent ally to defend.  The protecting character gains +2 to their **AC**.  If an enemy chooses to attack the protected character, the protecting character may make an **Opportunity Attack** against the attacker.  Additionally, if the protected character is hit, the protecting character may choose to take the hit for them.
- **Overrun:** Move through an opponent’s space once by winning an opposed **Strength** check.  You have **Advantage** on this check if you are at least one size category larger than your opponent.  You have **Disadvantage** if you are at least one size category smaller.
- **Ready an Item:** Move an item from your **Stashed** inventory to your **Readied** inventory or vice versa.
- **Withdraw:** Your movement during your current **Combat Turn** will not provoke any **Opportunity Attacks**.

### Move Actions
A standard **Move Action** allows a creature to move up to its movement rate.  Any form of movement (such as climbing, swimming, leaping or flying) is covered here.  Each creature gets one dedicated Move Action per Turn.  Additionally, the **Dash** Main Action may be used to perform a second Move Action in lieu of any other main actions.
- **Move:** Move up to your character’s movement rate using one of their available movement modes.
- **Stand Up:** Getting up from prone uses up half of your movement.
- **Leap, Horizontal:** A creature may leap horizontally up to half its movement rate without requiring a roll.  For greater distances, a **Strength** check must be made with a **DT** equal to 10 plus the number of additional feet to be crossed.  The total leap distance may not exceed the creature’s total movement.  A horizontal leap may cross any obstacle no higher than the creature’s **Strength Modifier** in feet (with a minimum of 1 foot).
- **Leap, Vertical:** A creature may leap a number of vertical feet equal to its **Strength Modifier** without requiring a roll (with a minimum of 1 foot).  Higher leaps require a **Strength** check with a **DT** equal to 15 plus 2 per additional foot.  The total leap height may not exceed double the creature’s Strength Modifier.  A vertical leap may not cross a horizontal distance greater than the creature’s reach.
- **Swim:** A creature may swim at half its ground movement rate.  Swimming in calm conditions or with the current does not require a roll.  Other conditions will require a **Strength** roll to successfully make progress.
- **Fly:** A creature cannot fly unless it has a defined flying movement rate.  Flying creatures ignore any terrain not at the same elevation.  Gaining altitude requires double the normal amount of movement, but lowering altitude only requires half.  Wind currents may also impact flying speed.
- **Burrow:** A creature cannot burrow unless it has a defined burrowing movement rate.  Burrowing creatures ignore all surface terrain, but different ground material compositions may impact their movement rate.  Digging deeper or shallower costs the normal amount of movement.
- **Teleportation:** Teleportation ignores all movement barriers and restrictions except those in the ending location.

### Free Actions
**Free Actions** are those minor actions that take virtually no time (such as dropping a held item, falling prone, shouting a warning, etc).  A creature may take as many free actions during their **Combat Turn** as the GM will allow.  Some Free Actions (such as speech) may be taken out of normal turn order at the GM’s discretion.

### Reactions
**Reactions** are sudden reflex actions that may be taken outside of the normal **Turn** order.  Each creature gets one Reaction per Round.
- **Cast:** Cast a **cantrip** or **spell** if the description states that it can be cast as a reaction.
- **Opportunity Attack:** Make a single attack (cannot be used with extra attacks) against a creature attempting to move out of your reach without first taking the **Withdraw** action.
- **Trigger a Readied Action:** If the set trigger occurs, take the readied action.

## Attacking an Enemy
Attacking an ememy requires making a successful [Attack Roll](RulesSynopsis.md#Attack-Roll) vs the target's **AC**.

### Fighting with Two Weapons
In order to wield 2 weapons, the weapon in the character’s primary hand must be a light or medium one-handed weapon, and the weapon in their off-hand must be a light one-handed weapon.

A character wielding two weapons has the option of using their off-hand weapon offensively or defensively.  This choice is made at the beginning of the character’s turn.  If the weapon is being used offensively, the character gains a +1 to hit bonus and may choose to strike with either weapon (not both).  If the weapon is being used defensively, the character gains a +1 AC bonus and may only attack with their primary weapon.

Under no circumstances is a character allowed to attack with both weapons at the same time.  However, if a character has multiple attacks per Combat Turn, then they may choose which weapon to strike with each time they make an attack.

See the [Off-Hand Proficiency](Traits.md#Off-Hand-Proficiency) trait for additional rules.

### Shields Shall be Splintered and Helmets Sundered
Any time a character takes a hit in combat from a direct attack (not an Area of Effect), before the damage dice are rolled, they may choose to sacrifice their shield (assuming they are wielding one) or helmet (again assuming they are wearing one) to cancel the hit.  A buckler or helmet sacrificed is destroyed.  A shield sacrificed is treated as a buckler until it is either repaired or destroyed.

Magical shields, bucklers and helmets are not immediately sacrificed but lose one of their magical traits or have any magical “pluses” reduced by 1.  Once all magical traits and pluses are gone, the item is treated as normal.

Shields, bucklers and helmets may be repaired by a skilled blacksmith.  The DC of the check is 15 and will restore a buckler or helmet to functional or return a damaged shield to normal.  If the roll is failed, the item is permanently destroyed.  Magical items may require re-enchantment.

### Damage
#### Critical Hits
If the attack roll exceeds the target’s **armor class** by at least 1 and is a **natural 20**, it is a **critical hit**.  When a PC takes a critical hit, they may take a [Lingering Injury](#Lingering-Injuries).  When a PC performs a critical hit, they do their normal damage, plus the max damage of their damage dice.  _For example, if an attack does 1d8 + 2 damage normally, a critical hit will do 1d8 + 2 + 8._

#### Death and Dying
A character can never be reduced below 0 HP.  As soon as a character drops to 0 HP, they fall **unconscious**.  When they are revived, they must check for a [Lingering Injury](#Lingering-Injuries).

Next, form a d4 [Countdown Pool](RulesSynopsis.md#Countdown-Pools) equal to their **Constitution bonus** + **Wisdom bonus** (minimum of 1).  This pool is rolled at the end of each of the character’s **Combat Turns**.  Once this **Countdown Pool** is emptied, the character dies.  Taking a hit while dying automatically removes 1 die from the pool.  Taking a **critical hit** removes 2 dice.

A character who is dying may be saved by another character attempting to stabilize them.  This is done with a **Wisdom/Healing** check vs DT 13 (DT 15 if done in the middle of combat).  On a success, the character is stabilized at 0 hit points.  On a critical success, the patient regains consciousness with a number of Hit Points equal to the roll of 1 Hit Die plus their Constitution bonus.

#### Lingering Injuries
When a character receives a **Critical Hit** or is reduced to 0 Hit Points, there is a chance they will receive a lingering injury.  The character must make a **Constitution check** vs DT 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher.  On a success, no lingering injury is accrued.  On a failure, the character rolls on the lingering injury table (at **Disadvantage** if the total damage exceeds the character’s **Constitution score**).

## Exhaustion
Exhaustion is a special condition representing a character’s endurance and being worn down by constant struggle and hardship.  Each time a character gains the **Fatigued** or **Exhausted** condition, they increase their rank of Exhaustion by 1.  Any time a character makes an ability check, their **Exhaustion Rank** acts as a negative modifier to the roll.  Additionally, at rank 1 Exhaustion, they subtract 5 feet from their movement speed.  This increases to having their movement speed halved at rank 6 and reduced to 0 at rank 10.  If a character’s Exhaustion Rank would ever exceed 10, that character immediately dies.

## Healing and Recovery
There are three types of rest in this system: Short, Long and Extended.
### Short Rest
A short rest is a 10-minute breather after which a character may regain a few hit points.  At the end of a Short rest, a character regains a number of hit points equal to the roll of 1 **hit die** plus their **Constitution Modifier**.  A character cannot benefit from more Short Rests in a 24 hour period than their Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).
### Long Rest
A long rest is at least 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep or light activity.  At the end of a long rest, a character heals back a number of hit points equal to 1 **hit die** plus their **Constitution Score**.  If they are under medical care, add the caretaker’s skill bonus to the total if they are trained in healing.  Additionally, a character maintaining a **Wealthy** or higher [lifestyle](Encumbrance_and_Equipment.md#Lifestyle-Expenses) adds a second hit die to the amount of hit points regained.

_For example, Merrick is a 5th level fighter with a 16 Constitution.  At the end of a short rest, he can regain 1d6 + 4 hit points (1d6+2 for his hit die plus another 2 for his constitution modifier).  At the end of a Long Rest with a superior quality meal while staying in a superior quality room at an inn, he’ll regain 2d6+4 (2 hit dice because of the wealthy lifestyle) + 16 (constitution score) hit points._

Additionally, any characters completing a long rest will recover one rank of [Exhaustion](#Exhaustion).  When their exhaustion rank reaches 0, they are no longer **Exhausted**.

If a character has any [Lingering Injuries](#Lingering-Injuries), they may be allowed a chance to recover from those injuries after a Long Rest.

If a Long Rest is interrupted, the characters will at least gain the benefits of a [Short Rest](#Short-Rest).

A character cannot benefit from more than 1 Long Rest in a 24 hour period.
### Extended Rest
An Extended Rest requires a full week’s rest at a **Safe Haven**.  A Safe Haven is defined as any location where characters can rest with no fear of danger nor any need to set up a watch.  Typically this is a friendly town, keep or the like where the characters have access to good food and warm beds. The GM will let the players know when their characters have encountered a Safe Haven.

At the end of an Extended Rest a character regains all **Hit Points**, recovers all ranks of [Exhaustion](#Exhaustion) and has advantage on any rolls to recover from [Lingering Injuries](#Lingering-Injuries).

No other **Downtime Activities** can be taken during an Extended Rest; your character is taking a week off to rest and recuperate.  

If an Extended Rest is interrupted, but the character has managed at least a full 8 hours of rest, they will gain the benefits of a [Long Rest](#Long-Rest).
### Medical Care
If a character is under the care of someone trained in medicine/healing, their recovery will be improved.  As mentioned above, under [Long Rests](#Long-Rest), a healer will add their **skill bonus** to the amount of **hit points** recovered during a long rest.  Additionally, they may add their caretaker’s skill bonus to any checks they make to recover from [Lingering Injuries](#Lingering-Injuries).
