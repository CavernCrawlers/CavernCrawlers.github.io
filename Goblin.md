## Features
### Fey Blooded
Due to their inherently magical nature, goblins gain a +2 bonus on all **Saving Throws** vs magic.
### Low-Light Vision
Goblins see in dim light nearly as well as full daylight; however, this vision is shades of gray only, so color cannot be discerned in these conditions.  Also, this ability does not function in full darkness.
### Small Stature
Being small hurts in a fight. You are a small creature and have **Disadvantage** wielding any weapon with the Heavy property, or when wielding a Versatile weapon one-handed.

On the other hand, you gain a +2 bonus on all Stealth checks.
### True Name
As fae creatures, goblins have **True Names**, and those with the knowledge may use an goblin’s true name against her. By calling out the true name, a character gains **Advantage** on all actions taken against the goblin, **attacks** and **saving throws**.

## Optional
### Life-Path
Your starting ability array is: STR 6, CON 9, DEX 9, INT 9, WIS 8, CHA 7
