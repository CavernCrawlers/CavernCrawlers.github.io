# Cosmic Allegiances

There exists, beyond the knowledge of ordinary mortals, great powers who contest with each other for dominance of the cosmos.  Most mortals are completely oblivious to the existence of such battles and simply go about their lives.  Many religions know hints and fragments of this conflict but few have a full picture of The Conflict.

However, there do exist some mortals who are drawn into The Conflict.  Such people may choose to align themselves with one of its factions (also called Pantheons).  In so doing, they earn the opportunity to influence this battle and which faction gains dominance.  On the other hand, this allegiance comes with great responsibility and duty as the deities, demons and other powers leading these Pantheons will make demands upon their followers.  In return, they grant significant power, if not always the freedom to use it as their servants would wish.

## Pledging
Characters do not start play aligned with any of the Pantheons in The Conflict.  Likely, they are completely unaware of The Conflict’s existence.  However, they may become aware of The Conflict through the course of their adventures, and thus gain the opportunity to align themselves with one of the Pantheons.  

The specifics of how this **Allegiance** is sworn is highly individual to both the character in question, and the faction (and specific faction agent) they are swearing allegiance to.  It may involve an oath sworn to a deity via elaborate ritual in one of its temples.  It may be that the character swears allegience to a greater power in a vision after visiting some long lost shrine.  It is left up to the GM and player involved to work out such details.

Once a character becomes a **Champion**, they gain the following features:

### Detect Allegiance 
**Champions** of the cosmic powers will find that they frequently recognize one another. When two Champions meet, they each make a **Wisdom Check** vs a **Difficulty** of 10 + the target’s **Hit Dice** and on a success, will know the other’s **Allegiance** and if they are a supernatural creature or not.

### Animosity
**Champions** and supernatural participants in The Conflict often hate those of other **Allegiances**. Any social checks between creatures of differing Allegiances are made at **Disadvantage** on all ability checks (count as 2 ranks of Disadvantage if of opposing Allegiances).

### A Life of Conflict
Perhaps the greatest downside to joining a faction of The Conflict is the fact that it will forever control your destiny.  Never more will your character be able to settle down to enjoy the simple life.  Agents of enemy Pantheons will seek you out and your own patron will require your services.  Perhaps you will find brief periods of rest in an isolated village or in a rich aristocrat’s palace, but eventually the conflict will draw you back in.

### Empowered
The character immediately gains an [Allegiance Trait](Traits.md#allegiance-traits).  This is in addition to the normal traits gained for leveling up.

### Cosmic Champion
Anyone who chooses to become a **Champion** in The Conflict are natural leaders for their faction.  As a result, they gain **Advantage** on any checks to lead, inspire or persuade other active participants of the same **Allegiance** who are of equal or lower rank in their faction.

### Summoned
**Champions** in The Conflict are subject to being summoned to service by the higher ranking members of their faction.  They may be called by the **Summoning** ritual, even to other planes of existence.

## Changing Allegiance
It is possible, though rare and dangerous, that a **Champion** can change her **Allegiance**.  Perhaps she decided that her faction’s goals do not align with her own, or some member(s) of her faction have committed acts she cannot be associated with.  Whatever the cause, she can choose to swear fealty to another faction; however there is no way to become unaligned (once one has joined The Conflict, one is always part of it).

The effects of changing **Allegiance** are as follows:  
- She immediately loses her previous **Allegiance** (naturally) and gains the new Allegiance.  
- She keeps any [Traits](Traits.md) that were gained as part of her previous Allegiance; though the details of those traits may change (such as changing the target of the [Rebuke [Allegiance]](Traits.md#rebuke-allegiance) trait.  
- Finally, she will be subject to a curse enacted by her previous patron (they do not take disloyalty lightly).  The exact nature of this curse should be worked out between the player and GM and it should be both appropriate to the faction being left and impactful on the life and abilities of the character.

## Cosmic Powers
There are many powerful Pantheons throughout the cosmos and the exact nature of those factions will be unique from campaign to campaign.  As an example of one such cosmology, the following is offered:

#### Chthonians
Also known as the Gods of Darkness, Gods of Chaos or the Gods of Limbo, are a pantheon of deities devoted to the idea that change is eternal and free will is the greatest virtue.  The very nature of these beings and their worship is anathema to an organized religion, thus their worship is spread among various small cults.  Additionally, many people only see the malevolent and destructive side of these gods and thus shun their worship; only speaking their names in whispered prayers to ward off their influence.  Others, mainly those among their various cults, espouse the positive and needed aspects of their deities' natures.

#### Empyreans
The Empyreans (Gods of Order, Gods of Light or Celestians) are a pantheon of gods who espouse law and order above all other virtues.  The Great Church of Celestos (colloquially just The Great Church) is a relatively new faith (within the last several generations) dedicated to the worship of the Empyreans.  They have quickly grown in influence and have become the official state religion of several kingdoms.  Their worshipers believe in a strict hierarchy and order to life, while their detractors view them as a source of potential tyranny and stagnation.

#### Elemental Monarchs
Some consider these enigmatic beings as the great gods of the elements while others simply view them as powerful elemental spirits that rule over all other lesser elementals.  Either way, their worship is not popular and only exists in small cults.  While most kingdoms don’t outlaw their worship, they typically aren’t recognized as official religions either.

#### Qliphotic
Variously known as the Lords of Hell, Demon Gods and Gods of Evil are said to rule over the many hells where the wicked are punished in the afterlife.  Some claim that their purpose is simply to punish those who have sinned against the other gods while others claim they try to directly influence mortals into committing sinful acts in order to collect their souls for the hosts of hell.  Either way, it is frequently prophesied that they will one day rise up against the gods to either overthrow them or bring about armageddon.  Their worship is typically outlawed in most civilized lands and where people do invoke them it is typically in expletives, curses or attempts at appeasement to avoid their ire.

#### Old Gods
An ancient pantheon whose worship dates back to before recorded history.  Many people still worship these deities, even those in lands that have become dominated by the Great Church.  They are a pantheon of gods over natural phenomena and their worship typically involves sacrifices and appeasements to either garner favor or ward off danger in endeavors related to their spheres of power.  Shrines and temples to the old gods can be found all over the land, many long forgotten and abandoned.

#### Derlethians
This is a collection of powerful cosmic entities that fall outside the normal structure of the cosmos.  Some believe these beings to be older than the Old Gods themselves and to possibly even pre-date creation.  They are considered enigmatic and inscrutable.  Some who worship these beings seek simply to ward off their malign influence while others believe that one or more of these beings will eventually be responsible for armageddon and believe that their worship will be rewarded in the aftermath.

# Morality
Morality is not simply a matter of picking a side.  Your **Allegiances** will give your character goals.  How your character goes about achieving those goals, however, is a matter of their Morality.

Morality is tracked on a simple scale of -5 (evil) to +5 (good) and is a reflection of your character’s actions.  Essentially, what your character does (and how they do it) is far more important than what they believe (or claim to believe).  Most characters and creatures exist somewhere in the -1 to +1 range and that is where your PC will start.  After a given adventure, the GM will assess what your character did and how they went about it.  If your character’s actions were brave, honorable, charitable and the like, their morality may increase.  If your character’s actions were cowardly, cruel, selfish or similar, their morality may decrease.

Once a character’s morality hit’s a value of -4 or lower, or +4 or higher, they can be detected as Evil or Good (respectively) by appropriate magic and other supernatural abilities.

Other-planar beings (like demons, angels, gods, elementals and the like), may have a fixed morality.  In such instances, they will always be Good, Evil or Neutral and, short of some type of miracle, cannot change their morality like a mortal can.
