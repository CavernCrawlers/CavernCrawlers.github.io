## Class Abilities

### Climb Sheer Surfaces
While anyone may attempt to climb a vertical surface with reasonable handholds (such as a rocky cliff face, tree or rope), a rogue may attempt to climb any surface even if only finger-tip holds are possible (such as a brick wall) without requiring specialized climbing gear.

### Fortune's Favor
You have greater luck than other characters.  Your Base and Max **Fortune Points** are each increased by 1.

### Mighty Deed
Once per turn, when you make a melee attack, you may declare a Mighty Deed.  Describe the special effect you wish to add to your attack (such as disarming an opponent, tripping them, pushing them back, etc).  If the attack hits, and the die face is equal to or greater than your Mighty Deed target number, the Mighty Deed succeeds.  Note that the Mighty Deed cannot add to the damage of the attack and the target's **Defenses** may apply.

### Search
Add this bonus on any attempt to find hidden things.  This bonus also applies when attempting to read lips.

### Skullduggery
This is a catch-all category for various underhanded/rogueish abilities (such as slieght-of-hand, deception, etc).

### Sneak Attack
When you have **Advantage** on an attack, add the listed damage to the attack.

### Other Rogue Skills
While any class may perform these feats of skill, the Rogue gains this additional class-based bonus based on level.
