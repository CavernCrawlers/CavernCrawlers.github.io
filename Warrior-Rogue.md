## Class Abilities
### Fortune's Favor
You have greater luck than other characters.  Your Base and Max **Fortune Points** are each increased by 1.

### Hauler
You add your **Constitution Modifier** (if positive) to your **Strength Score** for determining your **Encumbrance** limits.

### Highly Skilled
Warrior-Rogues receive 3 skills at first level instead of 2.  They gain an additional skill at level 3 and every 3 levels thereafter.  Instead of gaining a new skill, they may get better at one which they already have, increasing the bonus for that skill to +6.

### Mighty Deed
Once per turn, when you make a melee attack, you may declare a Mighty Deed.  Describe the special effect you wish to add to your attack (such as disarming an opponent, tripping them, pushing them back, etc).  If the attack hits, and the die face is equal to or greater than your Mighty Deed target number, the Mighty Deed succeeds.  Note that the Mighty Deed cannot add to the damage of the attack and the target's **Defenses** may apply.

### Minimum Damage
The amount listed as your **Damage Bonus** is not just the damage you add on weapon attacks.  This value is also the minimum amount of damage you will do on a missed attack, assuming the target’s AC is not higher than the listed AC.  *For example, a 6th level warrior-rogue will do 3 damage on a missed attack so long as the target’s AC is 13 or less.  Your normal damage modifiers also apply to this damage.*
