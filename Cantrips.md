## Beast Speech
**Casting Ability:** Charisma<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Personal<br/>
**Area:** Self<br/>
**Duration:** 1 hour<br/>
**Save:** None<br/>
Each time a mage learns this cantrip, they must pick a particular type of beast to which it will apply (such as canines, ursines, birds, felines, snakes, etc).  Once cast, the mage will gain the ability to converse with that type of beast for the cantrip's duration.  Interactions with these beasts follow the general rules for social interactions (regarding [reaction rolls](CoreRules.md#Charisma-and-Reactions), diplomacy and so forth).  However, it should be kept in mind that most normal beasts don’t have the same concerns or social norms.  Communication does not necessarily convey understanding.

A mage may attempt to converse with more than one type of beast at the same time (assuming they know the versions of this cantrip for each beast being addressed).  Doing so increases the rank of the cantrip to Rank 1 plus 1 per additional beast type.

## Beguilement
**Casting Ability:** Charisma<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** 1 Creature<br/>
**Duration:** 10 minutes<br/>
**Save:** Spirit<br/>
A mage uses this spell to influence the emotions and attitudes of the target creature.  If the target succeeds on their **saving throw**, they are unaffected but know that the caster was attempting to influence their mind with magic.  If the target fails, their emotional state moves toward the emotion selected by the caster.  This can grant a plus or minus 1 modifier on social checks, including rolls on the [Reaction Table](CoreRules.md#Charisma-and-Reactions).

## Conjure Sound
**Casting Ability:** Intelligence<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** n/a<br/>
**Duration:** 1 minute<br/>
**Save:** Spirit<br/>
With this cantrip, a mage conjures a distinct sound within range that is no louder than normal conversation.  The type of sound must be specific (footsteps, music, clinking coins, etc) but this cantrip may not be used for communication.  A creature who hears the sound may make a **Spirit** save in order to recognize the sound as not real.

## Glamour
**Casting Ability:** Charisma<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** Medium<br/>
**Duration:** 1 minute<br/>
**Save:** Spirit<br/>
This allows the mage to conjure a simple, silent and static illusion of roughly human size.  This illusion has no substance or weight.  Anyone observing the illusion will know it is not real with a successful **Spirit** save or upon physically interacting with it.

## Hexing
**Casting Ability:** Wisdom<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** 1 creature<br/>
**Duration:** 1 task (up to 1 hour)<br/>
**Save:** Spirit<br/>
By uttering this minor curse, the mage causes the targeted creature to have **Disadvantage** on the next roll they take for a particular action.  The action must be specified at the time of casting and must be specific (such as climb a tree, strike with a sword, haggle for a price).  As soon as the task is attempted, or if the duration expires without an attempt, the hexing fades.

## Inspire
**Casting Ability:** Wisdom<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 minute<br/>
**Range:** Touch<br/>
**Area:** 1 Creature<br/>
**Duration:** 1 task (up to 1 hour)<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
With a touch, words of encouragement and a small investment of magic, a mage can grant one creature +2 on a single roll to perform a specific task.  When this cantrip is invoked, the mage must name the task to which the bonus applies (e.g. “pick this lock” or “smite these bandits”).  As soon as the task is attempted, or if the duration expires without an attempt, the blessing fades.

## Mage Hand
**Casting Ability:** Intelligence<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** Tiny<br/>
**Duration:** 10 min (c)<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
This cantrip conjures a glowing translucent hand that the mage may use to manipulate small objects.  Such objects may be no larger than may fit in one hand and no heavier than 10 pounds.  It may not be used to wield weapons or make attacks, nor can it perform fine manipulations (such as lockpicking or pickpocketing).  

Increasing this cantrip's rank to 1 allows the hand to perform fine manipulations or can double the weight limit for each +1 rank.  It still may not be used to make attacks, however.

## Mage Light
**Casting Ability:** Intelligence<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Touch<br/>
**Area:** 1 object<br/>
**Duration:** 1 hour (c)<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
By means of this cantrip, a mage causes a touched object no larger than a fist to glow with the equivalent of candlelight.  This light may be of any color the caster wishes.

Increasing this cantrip's rank to 1 can increase the light's brightness to the equivalent of a torch or it can increase the duration by 1 hour per +1 rank.

## Nature’s Blessing
**Casting Ability:** Wisdom<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Touch<br/>
**Area:** Up to 10 square feet.<br/>
**Duration:** Instant<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
By this spell, a mage may cause any cutting or seed to root and any plant to bloom.  A mage who knows this cantrip may also use the Healing spell to heal wounded or blighted plants.

## Plant Speech
**Casting Ability:** Charisma<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Personal<br/>
**Area:** Self<br/>
**Duration:** 1 hour<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
This cantrip allows the caster to speak with plants of all varieties.  Unfortunately, plants are not known for being thrilling conversationalists.

## Spark
**Casting Ability:** Intelligence<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** 1 Creature/Object<br/>
**Duration:** Instant<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
With this cantrip, a mage learns to create a dangerous spark of a particular type of energy.  Each time this spell is learned, the mage learns one energy type to associate with it (acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, spirit, radiant or thunder).  When cast, the mage selects a known type of energy and hurls the spark at the target.  If the caster makes a successful [Magical Attack](MagicalArts.md#Magical-Attacks-and-Saving-Throws) roll, the target takes 1d4 damage of the selected type.

## Spirit Sight
**Casting Ability:** Wisdom<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Personal<br/>
**Area:** Self<br/>
**Duration:** 1 hour<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
This cantrip allows the caster to see spirits of any type.  This does not grant the caster the ability to communicate unless they happen to share a common language.
