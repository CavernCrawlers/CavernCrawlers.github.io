## Beast Speech
- **Tier:** Cantrip (0+)
- **Runes:** Beast
- **Casting Ability:** Charisma
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Area:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Save:** None
- **Components:** Incantations

Each time a mage learns this cantrip, they must pick a particular type of beast to which it will apply (such as canines, ursines, birds, felines, snakes, etc).  Once cast, the mage will gain the ability to converse with that type of beast for the cantrip's duration.  Interactions with these beasts follow the general rules for social interactions (regarding [reaction rolls](CoreRules.md#Charisma-and-Reactions), diplomacy and so forth).  However, it should be kept in mind that most normal beasts don’t have the same concerns or social norms.  Communication does not necessarily convey understanding.

A mage may attempt to converse with more than one type of beast at the same time (assuming they know the versions of this cantrip for each beast being addressed).  Doing so increases the rank of the cantrip by 1 per additional beast type.

## Beguilement
- **Tier:** Cantrip (0+)
- **Runes:** A form rune matching the type of the target creature.
- **Casting Ability:** Charisma
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Near
- **Area:** 1 Creature
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Save:** Spirit 8+
- **Components:** Incantations

A mage uses this spell to influence the emotions and attitudes of the target creature.  If the target succeeds on their **saving throw**, they are unaffected but know that the caster was attempting to influence their mind with magic.  If the target fails, their emotional state moves toward the emotion selected by the caster (and may potentially cause a Morale check).  This can grant a plus or minus 1 modifier on social checks, including rolls on the [Reaction Table](CoreRules.md#Charisma-and-Reactions) and Moral checks.

*Increased Ranks*
Each +1 Rank may be used for one of the following.
- Increase the saving throw difficulty by +2.
- Increase the duration 1 step.

- **Range:** Near
- **Area:** n/a
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Save:** Spirit 8+
- Components: Gestures

With this cantrip, a mage conjures a distinct sound within range that is no louder than normal conversation.  The type of sound must be specific (footsteps, music, clinking coins, etc) but this cantrip may not be used for communication.  A creature who hears the sound may make a **Spirit** save in order to recognize the sound as not real.

*Increased Ranks*
Each +1 Rank may be used for one of the following.
- Increase the saving throw difficulty by +2.

By uttering this minor curse, the mage causes the targeted creature to have -2 on the next roll they take for a particular action.  The action must be specified at the time of casting and must be specific (such as climb a tree, strike with a sword, haggle for a price).  As soon as the task is attempted, or if the duration expires without an attempt, the hexing fades.

*Increased Ranks*
Each +1 Rank may be used for one of the following.
- Increase the saving throw difficulty by +2.

With a touch, words of encouragement and a small investment of magic, a mage can grant one creature +2 on a single roll to perform a specific task.  When this cantrip is invoked, the mage must name the task to which the bonus applies (e.g. “pick this lock” or “smite these bandits”).  As soon as the task is attempted, or if the duration expires without an attempt, the blessing fades.

It may not be used to wield weapons or make attacks, nor can it perform fine manipulations (such as lockpicking or pickpocketing).  

*Increased Ranks*
Each +1 Rank may be used for one of the following.

By means of this spell, the mage uses the power of a rune to heal or mend a given object.  The rune selected when casting this spell must match the target type (Person for healing a sapient being, Beast to heal an animal, Earth to mend a stone wall, etc).

If used to heal a living being, this spell will heal the target's CON modifier (minimum 1) in HP.

If used on an inanimate object, 1 Tiny area of material will be made whole.  This area may be increased by 1 category per +1 rank.  Thus, to mend a cut hemp rope, the mage would apply the Plant rune at rank zero.  To mend a 10 x 10 x 5 foot section of castle wall (500 cubic feet) would require casting the spell at Rank 3 (for a Large area of effect).

*Increased Ranks*
Each +1 Rank may be used for one of the following.
- Increase the Range by 1 step (to a max of Far).
- Increase the the healing of a living target by 1 of that target's Hit Dice.
