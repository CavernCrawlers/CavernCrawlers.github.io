## Class Abilities

### Exhausting Magic
You may recover expended **Invocation Dice** gaining 1 level of **Exhaustion** per die after completing 10 minutes of meditation.

### Magical Focus
As part of your apprenticeship, you created a unique magical focus to aid in your spellcasting.  This focus may take most any form (a staff, wand, amulet or similar), but must be easily seen, recognized and hand-held.  So long as you have your Magical Focus, your **Invocation Dice** are only removed on rolls of 1, rather than 1 or 2.  A focus may be replaced by constructing a new one which takes 1 week in a safe haven and 50sp worth of materials.

### Magic User
You can harness the power of magic. A mage begins their career knowing two cantrips and two spells. You will need to select a **Magical Tradition** from which your spells will be drawn. You may not cast a spell of a Tier higher than half your level (rounded up). Your spells have a DT equal to the DT shown on the table below plus the spell's listed **Ability Score Modifier**.

### Sense Magic
Being naturally sensitive to the world of magic, you may determine if a person, place or thing is magical with a **Perception** check.  Doing so requires concentration and a few minutes; so you cannot tell if something is magical simply by being in its presence and people tend to notice when a mage is staring at them.  You can also attempt to decipher magical writing with an **Intelligence** check.

### True Name
As a magic-user possessing supernatural power, you have a **True Name**.  Those who know your True Name can use it against you.  By calling out your True Name, a creature gains **Advantage** on all actions taken against you, including attacks and you have **Disadvantage** on your **Invocation** checks to cast spells against them.
