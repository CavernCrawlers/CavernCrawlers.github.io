# Hirelings and Allies
There may come times when an adventuring group finds themselves in need of specialized help or just additional assistance.  This is when player characters must dig in to their coin pouches and try to persuade other people to work for them.  **Hirelings** are skilled or unskilled individuals who will hire on with a character for a predetermined length of time for a specified amount of pay (usually on a per-day basis).  **Allies** are those individuals who have a personal connection to a character and work with them for a share of the loot and glory rather than simple pay.

## Loyalty
Long-term **Hirelings** and all **Allies** have a **Loyalty Rating** describing how reliable the NPC is to the PC leading them.  Loyalty typically starts at +0 (Average) and will change over time depending on the hireling’s relationship with their employer.

A **Hireling** who attains a **Loyalty** of Elite or higher is a potential candidate to become an **Ally**.

### Loyalty Rating

| >= +10         | Unwavering |

## Retaining Hirelings
See the [Services](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#services) table for information on typical **Hireling** costs.

To employ a **Hireling**, the potential employer must first find a suitable Hireling and negotiate the terms of their employment.  Standard length of employment is usually a number of days, weeks, months, seasons or years and generally decided upon up front.  Once the terms have been offered, the prospective employer must make a **Charisma Check**.  The **Difficulty** of this hiring check starts at 10 + the potential hireling’s **Skill Rank Modifier** (for the skill in question) due to demand for highly skilled workers.  This Difficulty may be further modified by circumstances as seen fit by the GM (high or low pay being offered, potential danger, etc).  Compare the result to the table below.

### Hiring Check Result
| Outcome           | Result |
|:------------------|:-------|
| Fail by 8 or more | **Hostility**: The hireling will not only refuse employment but will speak poorly about the character to everyone they know, causing **Disadvantage** on all future hiring rolls in this locale for the next week. |
| Fail by 5 to 7    | **Refusal**: The hireling flat out refuses employment. |
| Fail by 1 to 5    | **Negotiation**: The hireling will negotiate for greater pay, better benefits or some similar concession. If granted, they will hire on with the character as normal. |
| Succeed by 0 to 2 | **Acceptance**: The hireling hires on as normal. |
| Succeed by 3+     | **Eager Acceptance**: The hireling hires on and gets a +1 modifier to their Loyalty score for every 3 full points by which the check Difficulty was exceeded. |

At the end of the term of employment, a rehire check may be made if the employer so desires.  This is generally the same as the original hiring check, but the roll is further modified by the hireling’s **Loyalty Score**.

Additionally, some circumstances may occur which will be cause for a **Loyalty Test**.  This is basically the same as a rehiring check, but may come about due to a calamity (the hireling is cursed, poisoned, severely injured, etc) or if their employer begins treating them poorly.

## Allies
**Allies** follow the above rules for **Hirelings** except that they do not have a defined term of service nor are they hired for pay.  Instead, they travel with their companion(s) for glory and a half-share of the loot.  They have a **Loyalty Rating** the same as a Hireling and their loyalty should be checked at the end of every adventure to see if they choose to stick around.  Similar to hirelings, calamities may also invoke a **Loyalty Test**.

A **Loyalty Test** is performed in the same manner as a Hiring / Rehire check for a **Hireling**.

A single character cannot have more **Allies** than their **Charisma Modifier** (minimum of 1).
