# True Names
Any character with a connection to the supernatural must have a true name.  This includes, fae creatures (elves, dwarves, goblins, etc), demons, gods, and any character capable of using magical arts.  Characters without supernatural connections may have a true name but it is not required.

## The Power in the Name
Calling out a being’s true name grants the speaker **Advantage** on any supernatural ability used against the named being as well as in any social interactions or contests of will against it.  It also negates any resistances the named creature may have against the speaker’s attacks and reduces immunities to resistances.  Finally, the speaker gains Advantage on any **saving throws** to resist the supernatural powers of the named creature.

Conversely, the named creature has **Disadvantage** on all **saving throws** and **ability checks** to resist the supernatural powers of the speaker, social influence or in willpower contests involving the speaker.

Calling out an ally’s true name while performing the **Help** action grants that ally an additional +1 on their roll.

Similarly, incorporating a being's true name into a healing spell, allows the caster to roll the effects of the healing spell twice and choose which result to use.

In all cases, the name must be called out loud enough for the target to hear the name, which means all present will learn that name.

## Who is Listening
Beings of great supernatural power, such as gods, arch-demons, fae lords, and the like, can potentially hear their true name uttered aloud from anywhere in the cosmos.  Exercise caution.

## Learning True Names
This is an excercise in role playing.  Some True Names may be recorded on ancient scrolls, or written on the walls of mouldering tombs.  Others may only exist in the dreams of dead gods or whatever other strange and wonderous place your GM's devious mind can think of.  Also, see the [Soul Gaze](Traits.md#Soul-Gaze) supernatural **Trait**.
