# Combat Maneuvers

Once per turn, as part of a normal melee attack, a Fighter may declare a Combat Maneuver.  This is a special move that won't do any extra damage, but can add additional consequences to the attack (such as tripping or disarming a foe).  If the d20 face shows a number equal to or higher than the fighter's Combat Exploit target, the exploit is successfully executed.  The defender may make a saving throw to negate the effect.  The target number of the save is always the total attack value rolled.

Non-fighters may also attempt **some** of these exploits (those marked with am asterisk) but the target is always 18+.

## Combat Maneuver Examples:

### Battle Cry
A roar, a shout, a stream of expletives; in some way you use your voice to try to unnerve your opponent.  You must be able to speak to use this maneuver.  The target must make a Spirit save or become [Frightened](Combat.md#frightened) until the *end* of their next turn.  This has no effect on mindless creatures or other beings immune to fear.

### Blinding*
From throwing sand in someone's face, to pulling their cloak hood over their eyes to slashing their brow so they bleed into their own eyes, you attempt  to impair your target's vision.  The target makes an **Evasion** save.  On a failure, the target becomes [Blinded](Combat.md#blinded) until the *end* of their next turn.  This obviously has no effect on creatures that don't use vision.

### Disarming
You twist your target's weapon in such a way that they must pass an **Evasion** save or it falls from their grasp.  Note that this only works on hand-held weapons, not natural weapons.  Weapons held in two hands make this save with **Advantage**.  If the save is failed, roll 1d10 to see where the target's weapon lands:

| d10 | Location |
|:---:|:---------|
|   1 | At the target's own feet. |
|   2 | At the attacker's feet. |
|   3 | 5 feet behind the defender. |
|   4 | 5 feet to the defender's left. |
|   5 | 5 feet to the defender's right. |
|   6 | 5 feet in front of the defender. |
|   7 | 5 feet to the defender's rear-left. |
|   8 | 5 feet to the defender's rear-right. |
|   9 | 5 feet to the defender's front-left. |
|  10 | 5 feet to the defender's front-right. |

### Impairment*
Striking at your foe's arm or hand, you attempt to weaken their ability to strike.  The target makes an **Evasion** save.  On a failure, they suffer **Disadvantage** on their next attack.  This cannot effect creatures immune to critical hits (such as undead and amorphous monsters).

### Juke*
You fake going one direction in order to slip past your foe by going the other way around.  The target must make an Evasion save.  On a failure, the attacker may use their movement to move through the target's space and to exit their reach without drawing an Opportunity Attack from the target.

### Shove*
You force your opponent to move a few steps back.  The target must make a **Hardiness** save.  On a failure, they must step back 5 feet into an open space (either straight back, back-left or back-right) and the attacker may (if they so choose), step into the previously occupied space.  If there is no open space, the target loses their balance and attacks against them have **Advantage** until the start of their next turn.  If the target is larger than the attacker, or has more than two legs, they make their save with advantage.  If they are smaller, they have disadvantage.

### Rally
You let out a rallying cry, perform a flashy maneuver or otherwise attempt to embolden your allies.  Any ally within Near range who can see and hear you adds your **Charisma Modifier** (minimum +1) their next morale or fear-based saving throw during this combat.  Allies who already have broken morale or are [Frightened](Combat.md#frightened) may immediately make a new save (adding your **CHA Mod**; min +1) to shake off the condition.

### Trip*
You try to take your opponent's feet out from under them.  The target must make an **Evasion** save.  On a failure, they are knocked [Prone](Cbomat.md#prone).  If the target is larger than the attacker, or has more than two legs, they make their save with advantage.  If they are smaller, they have disadvantage.  This has no effect on flying creatures or creatures without legs.

### Other
Describe some effect you wish to add to your attack.  The GM will decide what saving throw the target is allowed and the exact mechanical effects your exploit has.
