# Legendary Knacks
For levels 6-10

## Fighter

### %%Relentless%%
You do not automatically fall unconscious when reduced below 1 hit point.  Instead, at the beginning of each of your [turns](Combat.md#time), you must succeed on a diff 12 Hardiness save to remain conscious.  You still form a [Death Pool](Combat.md#Death%20and%20Dying) as normal; this ability simply gives you the chance to win or die on your feet.

## Rogue

### Decipher MagicDecipher MagicDecipher Magic%%
**Prerequisite:** [Code-Breaker](Knacks.md#code-breaker)
You may decipher magical text in the same manner as deciphering a code or unknown language.  The Code-Breaker bonus also applies to this check.  Additionally, if you decipher a spell scroll, you may attempt to cast the spell(s) on that scroll as if you were a Spellcaster, but you must pass a **Skilled Intelligence** check vs a diff equal to 9 plus 2 times the spell's tier (the difficulty on a Tier 3 spell scroll would be 15).
