# Combat Exploits
Replaces Mighty Deeds

As part of a normal melee attack, take advantage of a momentary weakness in the opponent's defense.  When making an attack, a Fighter may declair an exploit.  This is a special move that won't do any extra damage, but can add additional consequences to the attack (such as tripping or disarming a foe).  If the d20 face shows a number equal to or higher than the fighter's Combat Exploit target, the exploit is successfully executed.

Non-fighters may also attempt some of these exploits (those marked with am asterisk, '*') but the target is always 18+.

When an exploit's target number is met or exceeded, the defender must make a saving throw to negate the effect.  The target number of the save is always the total attack value rolled.

## Example Exploits:

### Battle Cry
A roar, a shout, a stream of explitives; in some way you use your voice to try to unnerve your opponent.  The target must make a Spirit save or become [Frightened](Combat.md#frightened).  The target may make a **difficulty 12 Spirit save** at the end of each of their turns to end this effect.  This has no effect on mindless creatures or other beings immune to fear.

### Blinding*
From throwing sand in someone's face, to pulling their cloak hood over their eyes to slashing their brow so they bleed into their own eyes, you attempt  to impair their vision.  The target makes an **Evasion** save.  On a failure, the target becomes [Blinded](Combat.md#blinded). They may make a **difficulty 12 Evasion save** at the end of each of their turns to end this effect.  This obviously has no effect on creatures that don't use vision.

### Disarming
You twist your target's weapon in such a way that they must pass an **Evasion** save or it falls from their grasp.  Note that this only works on hand-held weapons, not natural weapons.  Weapons held in two hands make this save with **Advantage**.  If the save is failed, roll 1d10 to see where the target's weapon lands:

| d10 | Location |
|:---:|:---------|
|   1 | At the target's own feet. |
|   2 | At the attacker's feet. |
|   3 | 5 feet behind the defender. |
|   4 | 5 feet to the defender's left. |
|   5 | 5 feet to the defender's right. |
|   6 | 5 feet in front of the defender. |
|   7 | 5 feet to the defender's rear-left. |
|   8 | 5 feet to the defender's rear-right. |
|   9 | 5 feet to the defender's front-left. |
|  10 | 5 feet to the defender's front-right. |

### Impairment*
Striking at your foe's arm or hand, you attempt to weaken their ability to strike.  The target makes an **Evasion** save.  On a failure, they suffer **Disadvantage** on their next attack.  This cannot effect creatures immune to critical hits (such as undead and amorphous monsters).

### Juke*
You fake going one direction in order to slip past your foe by going the other way around.  The target must make an Evasion save.  On a failure, the attacker may move through and past the target's square without drawing an Opportunity Attack from the target.

### Shove*
You force your opponent to move a few steps back.  The target must make a **Hardiness** save.  On a failure, they must step back 5 feet into an open space (either straight back, back-left or back-right) and the attacker may (if they so choose), step into the previously occupied space.  If there is no open space, the target loses their balance and attacks against them have **Advantage** until the start of their next turn.  If the target is larger than the attacker,or has more than two legs, they make their save with advantage.  If they are smaller, they have disadvantage.

### Rally
You let out a rallying cry, perform a flashy maneuver or otherwise attempt to embolden your allies.  Any ally within Near range who can see and hear you adds your **Charisma Modifier** (minimum +1) their next morale or fear-based saving throw during this combat.  Allies who already have broken morale or are [Frightened](Combat.md#frightened) may immediately make a new save (adding your **CHA Mod**; min +1) to shake off the affect.

### Trip*
You try to take your opponent's feet out from under them.  The target must make an **Evasion** save.  On a failure, they are knocked [Prone](Cbomat.md#prone).  If the target is larger than the attacker,or has more than two legs, they make their save with advantage.  If they are smaller, they have disadvantage.

### Other
Describe some effect you wish to add to your attack.  The GM will decide what saving throw the target is allowed and the exact mechanical effects your exploit has.
