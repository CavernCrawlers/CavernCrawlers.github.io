# Combat Exploits
Replaces Mighty Deeds

As part of a normal attack, take advantage of a momentary weakness in the opponent's defense.  For most characters, this occurs if the attack roll includes a *natural* 16+.  For Fighters and Hybrid-Fighters, this starts at a natural 14+ and improves with levels.

When an exploitable opportunity occurs, the player chooses a special effect to add to the attack (such as a trip, shove, disarm, etc.) This cannot add to damage, but can (and should) put the opponent in a disadvantageous position.  These potential opportunities will allow the defender to make a saving throw to negate the effect.  The target number of the save is always the total attack value rolled.

## Example Exploitable Opportunities:

### Blinding
From throwing sand in someone's face, to pulling their cloak hood over their eyes to slashing their brow so they bleed into their own eyes, you have see the opportunity to impair their vision.  The target makes an **Evasion** save.  On a failure, the target's vision becomes obscured and they have **Disadvantage** on all their **attacks** and **sight-based perception** checks. They may make a **difficulty 15 Hardiness save** at the end of each of their turns to end this effect.

### Disarming
You twist your target's weapon in such a way that they must pass an **Evasion** save or it falls from their grasp.  Note that this only works on hand-held weapons, not natural weapons.  Weapons held in two hands make this save with **Advantage**.  If the save is failed, roll 1d10 to see where the target's weapon lands:

| d10 | Location |
|:---:|:---------|
|   1 | At the target's own feet. |
|   2 | At the attacker's feet. |
|   3 | 5 feet behind the defender. |
|   4 | 5 feet to the defender's left. |
|   5 | 5 feet to the defender's right. |
|   6 | 5 feet in front of the defender. |
|   7 | 5 feet to the defender's rear-left. |
|   8 | 5 feet to the defender's rear-right. |
|   9 | 5 feet to the defender's front-left. |
|  10 | 5 feet to the defender's front-right. |

### Impairment
Striking at your foe's arm or hand, you attempt to weaken their ability to strike.  The target makes an **Evasion** save.  On a failure, they suffer **Disadvantage** on their next attack.

### Pushback
You see an opportunity to force your opponent to retreat a few steps.  The target must make a **Hardiness** save.  On a failure, they must step back 5 feet into an open space (either straight back, back-left or back-right).  If there is no open space, the target loses their balance and attacks against them have **Advantage** until the start of their next turn.

### Rally
You let out a battle cry, perform a flashy maneuver or otherwise attempt to rally your allies.  Any ally within Near range who can see and hear you gains **Advantage** on their next morale or fear-based saving throw during this combat.  Allies who already have broken morale or are [Frightened](Combat.md#frightened) may immediately make a new save (no advantage) to shake off the affect.

### Rending
You strike at your foes shield, helmet or armor in an attempt to damage it.  On a successful attack, the attacker must make a Strength check vs the appropriate difficulty from the following table.  On a success, the targeted object is damaged and has its effectiveness reduced.

If the targeted item is magical add +1 to the difficulty per +1 the item has plus the number of special powers it has.

Damaged and destroyed weapons can potentially be repaired by a suitably skilled crafter.

### Trip
You try to take your opponent's feet out from under them.  The target must make an **Evasion** save.  On a failure, they are knocked [prone](Cbomat.md#prone).

### Other
Describe some effect you wish to add to your attack.  The GM will decide what saving throw the target is allowed and the exact mechanical effects your exploit has.
