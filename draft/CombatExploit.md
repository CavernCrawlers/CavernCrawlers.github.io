# Combat Exploits
Replaces Mighty Deeds

As part of a normal melee attack, take advantage of a momentary weakness in the opponent's defense.  For most characters, this occurs if the attack roll includes a *natural* 16+.  For Fighters and Hybrid-Fighters, this starts at a natural 14+ and improves with levels.

When an exploitable opportunity occurs, the player chooses a special effect to add to the attack (such as a trip, shove, disarm, etc.) This cannot add to damage, but can (and should) put the opponent in a disadvantageous position.  These potential opportunities will allow the defender to make a saving throw to negate the effect.  The target number of the save is always the total attack value rolled.

## Example Exploitable Opportunities:

### Battle Cry
A roar, a shout, a stream of explitives; in some way you use your voice to try to unnerve your opponent.  The target must make a Spirit save or become [Frightened](Combat.md#frightened).  The target may make a **difficulty 12 Spirit save** at the end of each of their turns to end this effect.

### Blinding
From throwing sand in someone's face, to pulling their cloak hood over their eyes to slashing their brow so they bleed into their own eyes, you have see the opportunity to impair their vision.  The target makes an **Evasion** save.  On a failure, the target becomes [Blinded](Combat.md#blinded). They may make a **difficulty 12 Evasion save** at the end of each of their turns to end this effect.

### Disarming
You twist your target's weapon in such a way that they must pass an **Evasion** save or it falls from their grasp.  Note that this only works on hand-held weapons, not natural weapons.  Weapons held in two hands make this save with **Advantage**.  If the save is failed, roll 1d10 to see where the target's weapon lands:

| d10 | Location |
|:---:|:---------|
|   1 | At the target's own feet. |
|   2 | At the attacker's feet. |
|   3 | 5 feet behind the defender. |
|   4 | 5 feet to the defender's left. |
|   5 | 5 feet to the defender's right. |
|   6 | 5 feet in front of the defender. |
|   7 | 5 feet to the defender's rear-left. |
|   8 | 5 feet to the defender's rear-right. |
|   9 | 5 feet to the defender's front-left. |
|  10 | 5 feet to the defender's front-right. |

### Impairment
Striking at your foe's arm or hand, you attempt to weaken their ability to strike.  The target makes an **Evasion** save.  On a failure, they suffer **Disadvantage** on their next attack.

### Juke
You fake going one direction in order to slip past your foe by going the other way around.  The target must make an Evasion save.  On a failure, the attacker may move through and past the target's square without drawing an Opportunity Attack from the target.

### Overrun
You attempt to run right through your opponent, shoving them to the side.  The target must make a **Hardiness** save (at **Advantage** if they are at least 1 size category larger than the attacker; at **Disadvantage** if they are at least 1 size category smaller).  On a failure, the target is moved 1 space to the left or right (if an open space is available) and the attacker must continue with their full movement, but does not suffer any Opportunity Attacks from the target.  If no empty space exists, the target is knocked off balance and attacks against them have **Advantage** until the start of their next turn.

### Pushback
You see an opportunity to force your opponent to retreat a few steps.  The target must make a **Hardiness** save.  On a failure, they must step back 5 feet into an open space (either straight back, back-left or back-right) and the attacker may (if they so choose), step into the previously occupied space.  If there is no open space, the target loses their balance and attacks against them have **Advantage** until the start of their next turn.

### Rally
You let out a rallying cry, perform a flashy maneuver or otherwise attempt to embolden your allies.  Any ally within Near range who can see and hear you adds your **Charisma Modifier** (minimum +1) their next morale or fear-based saving throw during this combat.  Allies who already have broken morale or are [Frightened](Combat.md#frightened) may immediately make a new save (adding your **CHA Mod**; min +1) to shake off the affect.

### Sundering
You strike at your foes shield, helmet, weapon or other hand-held object in an attempt to damage it.  If the attack is successful, the target does not take any HP damage.  Instead the targeted object must make a saving throw vs. 10 or the damage done (whichever is higher).  The targeted object ads its Encumbrance value as well as any magical "pluses" it has.  It also adds the number of other magical abilities it has.  If the save is failed, the object is broken and useless but could potentially be repaired.
### Trip
You try to take your opponent's feet out from under them.  The target must make an **Evasion** save.  On a failure, they are knocked [Prone](Cbomat.md#prone).

### Other
Describe some effect you wish to add to your attack.  The GM will decide what saving throw the target is allowed and the exact mechanical effects your exploit has.
