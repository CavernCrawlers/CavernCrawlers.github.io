# Class Abilities

## Fighter

### Combat Maneuvers
Once per turn, when you make a [melee attack](Combat.md#melee%20attacks), you may attempt a [Combat Maneuver](Combat.md#combat%20maneuvers).  If the attack hits and the [Natural](CoreRules.md#Natural%20Roll) value of your [Attack Roll](CoreRules.md#attack%20roll) is equal to or greater than your *Combat Mastery* target number (see the table below), the maneuver succeeds.  Many maneuvers, however, do allow the target to make a [Saving Throw](CoreRules.md#saving%20throw).

### Hauler
You add your *Constitution Modifier* (if positive) to your *Strength Score* for determining your [Encumbrance](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#encumbrance) limits.

### Minimum Damage
Fighters are experts at dealing [Damage](Combat.md#damage).  If your attack misses the target's [AC](Combat.md#attacking%20an%20enemy) by your [Level](ExperienceAndLevels.md) or less, you still deal your attack's minimum damage to the target.

## Rogue

### Fortune's Favor
You have greater luck than other characters. You gain +2 to both your Base and Max [Fortune Points](CoreRules.md#fortune).

### Lesser Fortune's Favor
You have greater luck than other characters. You gain +1 to both your Base and Max [Fortune Points](CoreRules.md#fortune).

### Sneak Attack
When you have [Advantage](CoreRules.md#advantage%20and%20disadvantage) on an attack, add the listed damage on the table below to the attack.

## Spellcaster

### Magical Focus
As part of your apprenticeship, you created a unique [Magical Focus](MagicalArts.md#magical%20focus) to aid in your [Spellcasting](MagicalArts.md).  This focus may take most any form (a staff, wand, amulet or similar), but must be easily seen, recognized and hand-held.  It also takes up 1 [Inventory Slot](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#encumbrance).  A focus may be replaced by constructing a new one which takes 1 week in a [Safe Haven](Combat.md#extended%20rest) and 100sp worth of materials.

The benefit of your spellcasting focus is that you may carve a number of sigils into your focus equal to your [Caster Level](Glossary.md#caster%20level).  Each sigil represents a specific spell you have learned (i.e. recorded in your Spellbook).  Whenever you cast one of these spells, while your Magical Focus is in hand, you roll d8s for your Invocation Dice instead of d6s.  It takes 1 Day and 50sp times the spell's Rank to engrave a new sigil into your focus.

Having your Magical Focus in hand does not count against needing a free hand for spell casting.

### Spellcasting
You can harness the power of magic.  The table below shows the maximum [Tier](Spells.md#tier) of spell you may learn and add to your [Spellbook](MagicalArts.md#spellbooks).  You may cast [Spells](magic/Spells.md) you have prepared ahead of time.  Alternatively by increasing the casting time [one step](CoreRules.md#time%20steps) (with a 10 minute minimum), you may cast any spell that has been recorded in your Spellbook without the need to Prepare it first.
- [Invocation Dice:](MagicalArts.md#the%20invocation%20roll)  As a *Spellcaster*, you have a number of Invocation Dice as indicated on the table below plus additional dice equal to your *Wisdom Modifier*.  You may roll any number of these dice when attempting to cast a spell.
- [Prepared Spells](magic/MagicalArts.md#Preparing%20Spells):  You may Prepare the number of [Spells](magic/Spells.md) shown on the table below.  For 1st Tier spells, add your *Intelligence Modifier*.  It takes 10 minutes times the spell's Tier to prepare a Spell.
- **Spell Save Difficulty:** Your [Spells](magic/Spells.md) have the [Saving Throw](CoreRules.md#saving%20throw) [Difficulty](CoreRules.md#difficulty) shown on the table below plus your *Charisma Modifier*.
- **Exhausting Magic:**  At the cost of 1 level of [Exhaustion](Combat.md#Exhaustion), you may add half your [Caster Level](Glossary.md#caster%20level) (round up) to your [Invocation Roll](MagicalArts.md#the%20invocation%20roll) total as a [Free Action](Combat.md#free%20actions).
- See the [Magical Arts](magic/MagicalArts.md) and [Spells](magic/Spells.md) documents for further details.

At 1st level, you must select the [Magical Tradition](MagicalArts.md#traditions) your character follows.  This will determine which spells they have access to.

### Sense Magic
Being sensitive to the world of magic, you may determine if a person, place or thing is magical with an Intelligence+[Perception](Skills.md#perception) check.  Doing so requires [Concentration](Combat.md#concentrating) and a full minute; so you cannot tell if something is magical simply by being in its presence and people tend to notice when a mage is staring at them.  You can also attempt to decipher magical writing in the same way but using [Deduction](Skills.md#deduction) in place of Perception.

### True Name
As a magic-user possessing supernatural power, you have a [True Name](CoreRules.md#names).  Those who know your True Name can use it against you.  By calling out your True Name, a creature gains *Advantage* on all actions taken against you, including attacks.  They also gain *Advantage* on any saving throws to resist your [Spells](magic/Spells.md) or other supernatural abilities.
