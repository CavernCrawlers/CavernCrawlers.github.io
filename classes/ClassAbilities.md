# Class Abilities

## Fighter

### Combat Maneuvers
Once per turn, when you make a [melee attack](Combat.md#melee%20attacks), you may attempt a [Combat Maneuver](Combat.md#combat%20maneuvers).  If the attack hits and the [Natural](CoreRules.md#Natural%20Roll) value of your [Attack Roll](CoreRules.md#attack%20roll) is equal to or greater than your *Combat Mastery* target number (see the table below), the maneuver succeeds.  Many maneuvers, however, do allow the target to make a [Saving Throw](CoreRules.md#saving%20throw).

### Hauler
You add your *Constitution Modifier* (if positive) to your *Strength Score* for determining your [Encumbrance](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#encumbrance) limits.

### Minimum Damage
Fighters are experts at dealing [Damage](Combat.md#damage).  If your attack misses the target's [AC](Combat.md#attacking%20an%20enemy) by your [Level](ExperienceAndLevels.md) or less, you still deal your attack's minimum damage to the target.

## Rogue

### %%Fortune's Favor%%
You have greater luck than other characters. You gain +2 to both your Base and Max [Fortune Points](RulesSynopsis.md#fortune).

### %%Lesser Fortune's Favor%%
You have greater luck than other characters. You gain +1 to both your Base and Max [Fortune Points](RulesSynopsis.md#fortune).

### %%Rogue Skills%%
For specific [skill checks](RulesSynopsis.md#skilled%20check), Rogues gain an additional bonus beyond the normal **[Skill Bonus](Glossary.md#skill%20bonus)**.
- Climb & Sleight of Hand: +2
- Lock-Picking, Search, Stealth & Trap Handling: +1

### %%Sneak Attack%%
When you have **[Advantage](CoreRules.md#advantage%20and%20disadvantage)** on an attack, add the listed damage on the table below to the attack.

## Spellcaster

### %%Magical Focus%%
As part of your apprenticeship, you created a unique [magical focus](MagicalArts.md#magical%20focus) to aid in your [spellcasting](MagicalArts.md).  This focus may take most any form (a staff, wand, amulet or similar), but must be easily seen, recognized and hand-held.  It also takes up 1 [inventory slot](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#encumbrance).  A focus may be replaced by constructing a new one which takes 1 week in a [safe haven](Combat.md#extended%20rest) and 100sp worth of materials.

The benefit of your spellcasting focus is that you may carve a number of [sigils](Sigils.md) into your focus equal to your [Skill Bonus](Glossary.md#skill%20bonus).  Any [sigils](magic/Sigils.md) carved into your focus count as being in-hand when casting a spell.  Additionally, any time you cast a spell utilizing a sigil on your focus, you may roll d8s instead of d6s for your [Invocation Dice](MagicalArts.md#the%20invocation%20roll).  Your focus must be in-hand to gain these benefits.  It takes 1 Day and 50sp to engrave a new sigil into your focus.

### %%Spellcasting%%
You can harness the power of magic.  The table below shows the maximum [tier](Spells.md#tier) of spell you may learn and add to your [spellbook](MagicalArts.md#spellbooks).  You may cast [spells](magic/Spells.md) you have prepared ahead of time.  Alternatively by increasing the casting time [one step](RulesSynopsis.md#time%20steps) (with a 10 minute minimum), you may cast any spell that has been recorded in your spellbook without the need to prepare it first.
- **[Invocation Dice:](MagicalArts.md#the%20invocation%20roll)**  As a [spellcaster](classes/Spellcaster.md), you have a number of invocation dice as indicated on the table below plus additional dice equal to your **Wisdom Modifier**.  You may roll any number of these dice when attempting to cast a spell.
- **[Prepared Spells](magic/MagicalArts.md#Preparing%20Spell):**  You may [prepare](MagicalArts.md#Preparing%20Spells) the number of [spells](magic/Spells.md) shown on the table below plus your **Intelligence Modifier**.  It takes 10 minutes times the spell's Tier to prepare a spell (cantrips do not need to be prepared).
- **Spell Save Difficulty:** Your [spells](magic/Spells.md) have the [saving throw](CoreRules.md#saving%20throws) difficulty shown on the table below plus an ability modifier as determined by the spell's description.
- **Exhausting Magic:**  At the cost of 1 level of [Exhaustion](Combat.md#Exhaustion), you may add your **Skill Bonus** to your **[Invocation Roll](MagicalArts.md#the%20invocation%20roll)** as a [Free Action](Combat.md#free%20actions).
- See the [Magical Arts](magic/MagicalArts.md) and [Spells](magic/Spells.md) documents for further details.

### %%Sense Magic%%
Being sensitive to the world of magic, you may determine if a person, place or thing is magical with a [Skilled Intelligence](RulesSynopsis.md#skilled%20check) check.  Doing so requires concentration and a full minute; so you cannot tell if something is magical simply by being in its presence and people tend to notice when a mage is staring at them.  You can also attempt to decipher magical writing in the same way.

### %%True Name%%
As a magic-user possessing supernatural power, you have a [True Name](RulesSynopsis.md#names).  Those who know your True Name can use it against you.  By calling out your True Name, a creature gains **Advantage** on all actions taken against you, including attacks.  They also gain **Advantage** on any saving throws to resist your [spells](magic/Spells.md) or other supernatural abilities.
