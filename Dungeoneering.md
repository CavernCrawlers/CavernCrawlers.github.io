# Dungeoneering

## Exploration Turn Sequence
1. GM performs a Wandering [Monster check](CoreRules.md#Wandering-Monsters) (if needed).
2. The players declare the actions the party will take (moving, searching, listening, opening doors, etc).
3. The GM describes the results of their actions and what they see.  If a monster is encountered, play proceeds to the Encounter phase.
4. The GM and players perform any needed bookkeeping: advancing the Torch Timer, tracking spell durations, etc.

## Doors
Constructed dungeons (as opposed to natural caverns) will frequently have doors blocking access to different parts of the dungeon.  Depending on the environment of the dungeon (such as damp conditions), doors may be swollen and become stuck. The scenario will typically indicate if a door is stuck or not, but if such is not designated, the GM should assign a chance in 10 of any given door being shut (3 in 10 for the "typical" dungeon).

### Stuck Doors
A stuck door may be forced with a **Strength** check vs an appropriate **DT** (most should be in the Easy/10+ to Tricky/15+ range).  If the check is failed, the party loses any chance to surprise any creatures lurking on the opposite side.  Forcing a stuck door also counts as a loud event, possibly prompting a check for [wandering monsters](CoreRules.md#Wandering-Monsters).

### Locked Doors
These may be forced in the same manner as a stuck door.  Alternatively, a character with the appropriate tools (and training helps) may attempt to pick the lock.  This is a [Skilled](RulesSynopsis.md#Skilled-Check) **Dexterity** check vs. the lock's **DT**.  Typically only [Rogues](Rogue.md) and [Hybrid-Rogues](Glossary.md#Hybrid-Class) are considered skilled in this activity.

### Magic
There may also be spells capable of opening locked or stuck doors.

### Doors Swinging Shut
Again, most scenarios will indicate if a door will swing shut if left open.  If not explicitly called out by the scenario, assume a 3 in 4 chance that the door will swing shut if not propped open in some way.

### Hidden Doors
Concealed and Secret doors are both types of **hidden doors**.  The only real difference is that a secret door will be disguised as part of the environment (such as the classic swinging bookcase) while a concealed door is simply hidden behind some obscurement (such as a tapestry) but is obvious once the obscuring item is removed.  In either case, these doors will not be noticed unless the character is actively searching the area.  Concealed doors are frequently easier to detect than secret doors.

When searching an area containing a hidden door, the GM secretly rolls a [Perception check](CoreRules.md#Perception) for the searching character(s) vs. the hidden door's **DT**.  If the check is a success, the character's will know that a door is there, but not necessarily how to open it.

### Dungeon Denizens
It should be assumed that any denizens living in the dungeon will know how to open any locked/stuck doors easily.  They should also know the location of most (if not all) concealed and secret doors.  Creatures not living in the dungeons will frequently find themselves facing the same obstacles as the player-characters.

### Listening at Doors
Only one character at a time may listen at any given door (or two for a double-door; considered as [helping](CoreRules.md#Helping)). The listening character makes a [Perception](CoreRules.md#Perception) check using their hearing (if any particular bonuses or penalties apply; such as [Deafness](Combat.md#Deafened)) vs a **DT** determined by the GM.  If there are creatures on the other side of the door, and they are attempting to be [stealthy](CoreRules.md#Stealth), this is resolved as a [Contested Check](CoreRules.md#Contested-Checks) vs. stealth.  The referee should roll this check as the player-characters would not know if they failed or if there is simply nothing on the other side of the door.
