# Runes

It is believed by many that runes represent the language the gods used in the creation of the cosmos.  This is the reason some believe that magic is solely the provenance of the gods and that mortal casters are committing blasphemy by practicing magic. Regardless of their true nature, it is runes that empower magic.

[Full spellcasters](Glossary.md#full-class) begin play knowing Charisma Modifier + 1 (minimum 1) runes.  [Hybrid spellcasters](Glossar.md#hybrid-class)) begin play with just Charisma Modifier (minimum 1) runes.  More must be discovered in play.

## Learning New Runes
It is an exercise for the caster to locate new runes.  This is a frequent motivation for spellcasters to adventure; locating new runes in ancient texts, unexplored tombs and so forth.  Additionally, spellcasters may share their runes, but (even more-so than spells), runes are a jealously guarded secret.  No spellcaster will willingly share knowledge of a rune without first extracting some price or service from the asker.

Once a rune has been discovered, it must be inscribed.  Typically this is on a specially prepared object; such as a stone, crystal, prepared wood, or special parchment (the exact device is up to the caster).  Many caster carve their known runes into their [Magical Focus](MagicalArts.md#magical-focus), so that their runes are easily at hand when needed (this is one reason why experienced and knowledgeable mages prefer staffs).  Inscribing a rune requires 1 hour and 50sp plus the cost of the object on which it is being inscribed.
