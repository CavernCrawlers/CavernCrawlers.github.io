# Runes

It is believed by many that runes represent the language the gods used in the creation of the cosmos.

Runes empower magic.

Full spellcasters begin play knowing Charisma Modifier + 1 (minimum 1) runes.  Hybrid spellcasters begin play with just Charisma Modifier (minimum 1) runes.  More must be discovered in play.

# Formula
Formula are used to control magic.  These are the individual spells a mage knows.  Formula are combined with Runes to create a specific effect.  The rune used will determine things like damage type and target type.  The formula used will determine other aspects of the spell.

# Caster
The caster is the final fundamental ingredient of magic.  Casters empower a spell via their Invocation Dice.

# Example Spells

## Spark
- Rank: 0 (cantrip)
- Rune(s): any elemental
- Casting Ability: Intelligence
- Casting Time: 1 Action
- Range: Close
- Area: 1 Creature/Object
- Duration: Instant
- Save: none
- Components: Gestures and Incantations

By means of this spell, the caster uses the power of a rune to conjure a small amount of a single element (approximately 1 cubic inch).  When this spell is cast, the mage selects the empowering rune (and damage type) of the spell.  At it's minimum, this spell does negligible damage, but can produce utilitarian effects (such as using the Fire rune to ignite a torch).  Alternatively, the mage may use this as an attack (requiring a magical attack vs an unwilling target), doing 1d4 damage of the selected type.

The range of this spell may be increased 1 category per +1 Rank (up to a maximum of Far).

The number of targets may be increased by 1 per +1 Rank.

The damage may be increased by 1 die type per +1 Rank.

## Mend
- Rank: 0 (cantrip)
- Rune(s): form or elemental
- Casting Ability: Wisdom
- Casting Time: 1 Action
- Range: Touch
- Area: 1 Creature or a Tiny area
- Duration: Instant
- Save: none
- Components: Gestures and Incantations
By means of this spell, the mage uses the power of a rune to heal or mend a given object.  The rune selected when casting this spell must match the target type (Person for healing a sapient being, Beast to heal an animal, Earth to mend a stone wall, etc).

If used to heal a living being, this spell will heal the target's CON modifier (minimum 1) in HP.  For each +1 Rank added, increase the healing by 1 of the target's Hit Dice.  The number of creatures healed may be increased by +1 per +1 Rank.

If used on an inanimate object, 1 Tiny area of material will be made whole.  This area may be increased by 1 category per +1 rank.  Thus, to mend a cut hemp rope, the mage would apply the Plant rune at rank zero.  To mend a 10 x 10 x 5 foot section of castle wall (500 cubic feet) would require casting the spell at Rank 3 (for a Large area of effect).

The range of this spell may be increased 1 step per +1 Rank (max Far).
