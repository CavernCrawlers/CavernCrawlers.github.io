# Traits
Traits help set individual characters apart from one another, even if they are of the same species, class and general background.  Each trait represents some specific inborn ability or special training unique to that character.  They are different from Knacks in that they have no class requirements.

Each character gains their first Trait at level 5 and gains an additional trait every 4 levels thereafter.

Traits are broken into multiple distinct types: General, Allegiance, Combat, Spellcasting and Supernatural.

Unless otherwise noted, each trait may only be taken once.

## General Traits

General traits are fit to be taken by any character and provide bonuses outside the realm of combat.

### Actor
Your character is skilled at mimicry and dramatics.  They gain +2 on any performance or deception checks and can mimic accents and speech patterns.

### Alert
Your character is always on the lookout for danger.  They gain +1 **Initiative** and have +2 on **Perception** rolls to avoid being surprised.

### Always Prepared 
Your character often has unusual but helpful objects at hand. He may spend a **Fortune Point** to have any item he might have reasonably procured along the way and which could fit in his bag.

### Armor Training (light, medium or heavy)
Your character understands how to move in a particular weight of armor effectively.  They must have light armor training before they can take medium.  They must have medium armor training before they can take heavy.

### Catch Your Breath
You can recover 1 level of **Exhaustion** with a **Short Rest**.

### Die Hard
Your death **Countdown Pool** is made up of d6s instead of d4s.

### Fast Healer
You roll an additional **Hit Die** when rolling for recovered **Hit Points** after a **Short** or **Long Rest**.

### Friendly Face 
Your character’s good nature and handsome face cause strangers to trust her more than they otherwise would. She gains +2 on all **Charisma Checks** with strangers.

### Gifted Climber 
While anyone can climb a rope or rocky outcrop with a simple **Athletics Check**, this character has the uncanny ability to climb almost any surface, including seemingly sheer rock faces. The character must make checks as normal when climbing in this manner, but is able to attempt climbs impossible to others without special equipment.

### Great Bravery
While this character certainly becomes frightened, she will not back down because of fear. This character is immune to the **Frightened** condition.

### Great Fortune
Your starting and max **Fortune Point** values increase by 1 each.  You may take this trait twice.

### Great Leader 
Like the heroes of past ages, the character commands respect by his bearing alone. By spending a **Fortune Point**, this character can give all of his companions +2 to all of their rolls during the next **Round**.

### Healer
Your character is a gifted practitioner of medicine.  When caring for someone who is healing, the **HP** they gain from your Healing skill is doubled.

### Linguist
Due to study and a gift for languages, this character knows three additional languages.  This trait may be taken multiple times, gaining three new languages each time.

### Merchant’s Eye 
The character has a gift for appraising objects of various sorts. Under ordinary circumstances, the character automatically knows the approximate value of any item.

### Second Wind
A brief moment’s respite is all this character needs to be ready to get back into the fight. This character may spend a **Fortune Point** to take 1 minute to rest and gain the benefits of a **Short Rest**.  This does not count against their daily short rest limit.

### Self Improvement
Raise one of your character’s **Ability Scores** by 2 points, or two Ability Scores by 1 point each.  No Ability Score may be raised above 18 in this fashion.  This trait may be taken multiple times.

### Superior Training
Learn an additional **Knack** from your class.

### Survivalist
This character is at home in the wilds. She can always find enough food and water for herself, though still must make foraging or hunting tests to feed others. This trait has no effect when in the harshest of conditions, such as a scalding desert or a Dark Lord’s blighted domain.

### Tenacity 
Some heroes don’t know when to quit and will stay in the fight against all odds. The character gains an additional **Hit Point** per level, including any past levels if this **Trait** is chosen later in a character’s career.

### Unassuming
This character has an uncanny knack for escaping notice. At the beginning of any encounter she may spend a **Fortune Point** to be automatically hidden without any roll, provided that the surroundings would allow it.

### Very Helpful
When this character **Helps** another, double the bonus this character grants to the ability check.

### Weapon Training
This character gains proficiency with an additional weapon group.  This trait may be taken multiple times.

## Allegiance Traits
Each of these traits requires a character to have sworn **Allegiance** to a Cosmic Power before they can be taken.

### Breaker of [Allegiance]
A character cannot be of the named **Allegiance** when taking this trait.  Their blows are filled with the power of their cosmic patron and thus grant +2 to hit and damage against creatures of the named Allegiance.  After scoring a hit against a creature of the named Allegiance, this character may spend a **Fortune Point** to have their attack automatically do maximum damage.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different Allegiance each time.

### Rebuke [Allegiance]
A character cannot be of the named **Allegiance** when taking this trait.  This character’s very presence is an anathema to supernatural creatures of the named Allegiance.  This character may use their action to attempt to drive off supernatural creatures of the named Allegiance.  This character makes a **Charisma Check**, adding in half their **Character Level** (rounded down) as a bonus.  Any affected creatures able to see and hear the character whose **Spirit Defense** is lower than the check value becomes **Frightened** of the character for the next minute.  If the check is also a critical success, those creature are **Routed** for the next 24 hours.  Any creature with a Spirit Defense higher than the check value becomes immune to this ability from this character for the next 24 hours, unless the character spends a Fortune Point.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different Allegiance each time.

### Summoner
The character may cast the Summoning ritual to summon supernatural creatures as a **Mage** of his level using the highest of his **Intelligence**, **Wisdom** or **Charisma Modifiers** when doing so.  The creature summoned must be of the same **Allegiance** as the character.

### Warded Against [Allegiance]
A character cannot be of the named **Allegiance**.  This character has +2 on **Defenses** against the supernatural powers of creatures of the named Allegiance.  The character may also spend a **Fortune Point** to impose **Disadvantage** on the use of those supernatural powers.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different Allegiance each time.

## Combat Traits

These are traits which will directly improve the combat prowess of a given character, but are not so specialized as to require one to be a **Warrior**.  As a result, characters of any class may take these traits.

### Combat Mastery
This character’s skill at arms is unmatched. If her level is greater than the **Hit Dice** of her strongest opponent, she gains +2 on all to-hit rolls and +2 armor class.

### Crossbow Expert
This character has spent long hours practicing with crossbows.  Reloading a crossbow no longer takes an action, and you can attack adjacent foes or fire into melee with your crossbow without penalty.

### Duelist
A character with this trait is skilled at fighting opponents in single combat. If the character is fighting any other single small, medium or large sized opponent in a one-on-one duel, he receives a +2 bonus to hit and a +2 bonus to armor class. These bonuses promptly disappear as soon as bystanders intervene.

### Favored Enemy
This character bears a grudge toward a particular type of foe, such as goblins, wizards, or dragons. When facing such foes, this character gains a +2 bonus on **Defenses** to resist any of their supernatural powers and does an additional 2 damage when attacking them.  This trait may be taken multiple times, gaining a different favored enemy each time.

### Knife Fighting
When this character is armed with two daggers, he receives a +1 bonus to hit, a +1 bonus to AC, and does 2d4p/s damage in melee combat.

### Mage Slayer
If a creature within melee reach casts a spell, this character may use their reaction to make a melee attack against it.  When a creature must make a **Concentration Check** due to damage caused by this character, it does so with **Disadvantage**.

### Off-Hand Proficiency
This character may wield a medium one-handed weapon in their off-hand at the same time as they wield a medium one-handed weapon in their primary hand.  While doing so this character gains a +1 bonus to both AC and to hit and may attack with either weapon.  See Fighting with Two Weapons for the normal rules.

### Panther’s Grace 
When unarmored, this character receives a +3 bonus to AC. The character may still bear a shield or wear magical trinkets or jewelry and gain the benefits of this Trait.

### Unarmed Combat
The character is dangerous even without a weapon in her hand. This character’s unarmed combat attacks do damage based on the character’s **Base Attack Bonus**.  Damage starts out at 1d4b.  When a character reaches a Base Attack Bonus of +5, their unarmed damage increases to 1d6b.  At BAB +9, unarmed attacks will do 1d8b damage.  Finally, at BAB +13 and higher, unarmed attacks will do 1d10b damage.

## Spellcasting Traits

Most of these **Traits** are only available to characters who possess the ability to utilize **Magical Arts**.  The exception is the [Touched by Magic](#touched-by-magic) trait, which will then qualify the character of other traits of this type.

### Flexible Ritualist
This character casts **Rituals** in ways different from other mages. The player may pick two Rituals and change which **Ability Score** is associated with **Checks** for casting those Rituals. The player may choose **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, or **Charisma** for their **Invocation Checks**, and need not necessarily choose the same Ability Score for each ritual. The player is not required to pick both Rituals when this trait is gained, and may instead “hold” some of his picks for later Rituals.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to different Rituals each time.

### Potent Magic
The caster picks two **Magical Arts** that she already knows.  When making a **Magical Attack Roll** with one of these Magical Arts, she adds +2 to the roll.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to different Magical Arts each time.

### Practiced Ritual
The mage has practiced and memorized a single ritual so many times, he may cast it without need of his spellbook or a scroll.  He still requires all other ritual ingredients.  This trait may be taken multiple times, each time applying to a different ritual.

### Skilled Caster
After a great deal of practice, this character has mastered a particular type of magic. Choose two **Magical Arts** known by the character; she gains +2 on all **Invocation Checks** for the Arts in question.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to different Magical Arts each time.

### Supreme Concentration
This mage may **Concentrate** on 2 **Magical Arts** at the same time.  If an event will potentially break his Concentration, he must make a Concentration Check for each art.

### Touched by Magic
Some have a wild, untrained gift for the **Magic Arts**; others learn just a bit and then do not continue their studies. This character can cast a single **Cantrip**, **Spell**, or rank one **Ritual**.  She has 2 **Invocation Dice** with which to invoke this one Magical Art. Any Magical Art cast using this trait is always cast at its base level.  

This **Trait** does nothing for a mage, though it may be helpful to a multiclass mage.  This trait may be taken multiple times to learn additional magic but no additional Invocation Dice are gained.

### War Wizard
Through martial training and practice, this mage has learned how best to harness the destructive powers of magic. He may add his Ability Modifier to the damage of any **Magical Art** he casts.  The Ability Modifier used is the one named by the Magical Art itself.

### Well of Power
This mage may spend a **Fortune Point** to regain a number of lost Invocation Dice equal to the highest of her **Intelligence**, **Wisdom** or **Charisma** modifiers upon completing a **Short Rest**.

### With But a Wave
Even without a **Magical Focus**, this mage only loses **Invocation Dice** that come up a '1'.

## Supernatural Traits

### [Beast] Speech
Whether because of heritage, a mystical pact, or an unknown gift, this character has a great affinity with the named type of animal. She may speak with them, has a rough sense of when they are nearby, and gains a +2 on any rolls involving them.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different animal type each time.

### Child of the [Terrain]
Pick a terrain type (such as forest, desert, ocean, mountain, etc).  This character can never become lost in this terrain except by magical means.  Additionally, sometimes the spirits of the land in this terrain whisper to her and she gains +2 on any **Charisma Check** to interact with such spirits.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different terrain type each time.

### [Elemental] Caller
Due to bloodline or oath, all manifested or aware elementals of the named type in Near range of the character must present themselves; socially if they are capable of speech, or wordlessly if they are not. The character can perceive them even if they are invisible or inaudible.  This character gains the appropriate elemental language as a bonus language.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different elemental type each time.

### Fae Touched
This character has been exposed to the magic of Faerie or has fae blood running in their veins.  They gain a +2 bonus to any **Defense** vs magic.  Additionally, at around mid-puberty, their aging tends to slow to half the normal rate for their species.  Characters that are already Fae Blooded (such as Dwarves, Elves and Goblins) cannot take this trait.

### Ghost-Touched
This character is marked in some way by the dead. After the sun has set, the character may see any ghosts in his presence. Note that this trait does not allow the character to see other types of invisible spirits.

### Healing Touch
The character’s hands have the power to heal the sick and wounded. This character may lay hands on another and grant them the same benefits as a **Short Rest** (though this does not count against the number of short rests they may take in a day).  Once this trait has been used, it cannot be used again until this character completes a **Long Rest**.  This trait may be taken multiple times, to gain additional uses of this ability (regaining only 1 use per Long Rest).

### Infuse Weapon
You may infuse part of your soul into your weapon attacks (including unarmed).  When you do so, your attacks are treated as magical for the next minute, after which you gain 1 level of **Exhaustion**.

### Oathkeeper
When this character witnesses an oath or makes one herself, fate binds the oath taker to see it done. Anyone who makes an oath in the character’s presence, including the character herself, must keep their word or find themselves halving all healing received and unable to regain **Fortune Points** unless they are working towards fulfilling their oath.

### Second Sight
This character gains the **Sense Magic** ability as if they were a [Mage](Mage.md#sense-magic).

### Shapechanger
As given in the core rules with the following exceptions:  This change lasts for 1 hour per **Character Level**. Changing back earlier requires a **Wisdom Check** vs DT 13 or the expenditure of a **Fortune Point**.

### Soul Gaze
This character has the frightening ability to look into another’s soul. When this character first encounters any creature with a **True Name**, she may spend a **Fortune Point** to learn the creature’s **Allegiance** (if any) and **Type**.  Additionally, she may make a **Charisma Check** for a chance that the creature’s True Name will come to her that night in a dream.  The **DT** of the check is 10 + 1 per **Hit Die** of the target.

### Spirit Friend
For some reason, spirits are naturally disposed to like or obey this character. Perhaps she is more real to them than other physical beings, or has a mystical heritage of some sort. The character gains +2 on all social checks involving disembodied spirits and on all rolls to summon or bind them.
