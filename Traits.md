# Traits
Traits help set individual characters apart from one another, even if they are of the same species, class and general [background](Background.md).  Each trait represents some specific inborn ability or special training unique to that character.  They are different from Knacks in that they have no class requirements.

Each class abilities table shows when characters gain Traits.

Traits are broken into multiple distinct types: General, Allegiance, Combat, Spellcasting and Supernatural.

Unless otherwise noted, each trait may only be taken once.

If you start play with this Trait, you may select a normal animal to be your companion at the start of play (so long as it complies with the above restrictions).  As you grow in power, so to will your companion, gaining their own experience in the same manner as any other Ally.  It is up to the GM to adjudicate when they have amassed enough XP to gain a new HD, but typically aggressive (or trained in combat) animals should level up as a [fighter](Fighter.md) while more docile animals should level up as a [Rogue](Rogue.md).  Upon gaining additional HD, the beast may gain additional bonuses to hit and on saving throws (similar to other beasts of similar HD).  It is up to the GM whether any additional abilities may be gained.

If a roll is deemed necessary, the character makes it as a [Skilled](RulesSynopsis.md#skilled%20check) check.  If it is already a Skilled check for the character (such as being of the [Merchant](Background.md#merchant) background), they have **Advantage** on appraisal checks.

### Second Wind
A brief moment’s respite is all your character needs to be ready to get back into the fight. They may spend a [Fortune Point](RulesSynopsis.md#fortune) and take 1 minute to rest and gain the benefits of a [Short Rest](Combat.md#short%20rest).

### Weapon Training
Your character gains proficiency with an additional class of weapons.  This trait may be taken multiple times.

### Wise

## Allegiance Traits
Each of these traits requires a character to have sworn [Allegiance](AllegiancesAndMorality.md) to a [Cosmic Power](AllegiancesAndMorality.md#Cosmic%20Powers) before they can be taken.

### Breaker of {Allegiance}
A character cannot be of the named **Allegiance** when taking this trait.  Their blows are filled with the power of their cosmic patron and thus grant +2 to hit and damage against creatures of the named Allegiance and also count as magical for **resistance** and **immunity** purposes.  After scoring a hit against a creature of the named Allegiance, this character may spend a [Fortune Point](RulesSynopsis.md#fortune) to have their attack automatically do maximum damage.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different Allegiance each time.

### Rebuke {Allegiance}

Any creatures able to see and hear her must make a **Spirit Saving Throw** using the check's total as the **DT**.  If the creature's total is lower than the DT it becomes **Frightened** of your character for the next minute.  If the Charisma check was also a critical success, those creature are **Routed** for the next 24 hours.  Any creature whose Spirit Save is equal to or higher than the DT becomes immune to this ability from your character for the next 24 hours, unless she spends a Fortune Point.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different Allegiance each time.

### Summoner
The character may cast the Summoning ritual to summon supernatural creatures as a **Spellcaster** of his level using the highest of his **Intelligence**, **Wisdom** or **Charisma Modifiers** when doing so.  The creature summoned must be of the same **Allegiance** as the character.

### Warded Against {Allegiance}
A character cannot be of the named **Allegiance**.  Your character has **Advantage** on **Saving Throws** against the supernatural powers of creatures of the named Allegiance.  Your character may also spend a **Fortune Point** to automatically pass a failed Saving Throw verses those supernatural powers.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different Allegiance each time.

## Combat Traits

These are traits which will directly improve the combat prowess of a given character, but are not so specialized as to require one to be a **[Fighter](classes/Fighter.md)**.  As a result, characters of any class may take these traits.

### Blind Fighting
This character does not suffer the [Blinded](Combat.md#blinded) condition against opponent's at [Close](Combat.md#range%20bands) range.

### Combat Dominance
This character’s skill at arms is unmatched. If her level is greater than the **Hit Dice** of her strongest opponent, she gains +2 on all to-hit rolls and +2 armor class.

### Crossbow Expert
This character has spent long hours practicing with crossbows.  Reloading a crossbow no longer takes an action, and your character can attack adjacent foes or fire into melee with their crossbow without penalty.

### Duelist
A character with this trait is skilled at fighting opponents in single combat. If your character is fighting any other single **small**, **medium** or **large** sized opponent in a one-on-one duel, he receives a +2 bonus to hit and a +2 bonus to armor class. These bonuses promptly disappear as soon as bystanders intervene.

### Favored Enemy
Your character bears a grudge toward a particular type of foe, such as goblins, wizards, or dragons. When facing such foes, they gain a +2 bonus on **Defenses** to resist any of the favored enemy's supernatural powers and does an additional 2 damage when attacking them.  This trait may be taken multiple times, gaining a different favored enemy each time.

### Knife Fighting
When your character is armed with two daggers, he receives a +1 bonus to hit, a +1 bonus to AC, and does 2d4p/s damage in melee combat.

### Mage Slayer
If a creature within melee reach casts a spell, your character may use their reaction to make a melee attack against it.  When a creature must make a **Concentration Check** due to your character's actions, it does so with **Disadvantage**.

### Off-Hand Proficiency
Your character may wield a medium one-handed weapon in her off-hand at the same time as she wields a medium one-handed weapon in her primary hand.  While doing so she gains a +1 bonus to both AC and to hit and may attack with either weapon.  See Fighting with Two Weapons for the normal rules.

### Panther's Grace 
When unarmored, your character receives a +3 bonus to AC. He may still bear a shield or wear magical trinkets or jewelry and gain the benefits of this Trait.

### Unarmed Combat
Your character is dangerous even without a weapon in her hand. Her unarmed combat attacks do 1d6b damage.  This trait may be taken multiple times, increasing the unarmed damage die by one step each time (to a max of 1d10).

## Spellcasting Traits

Most of these **Traits** are only available to characters who possess the ability to utilize **Magical Arts**.  The exception is the [Touched by Magic](#touched%20by%20magic) trait, which will then qualify the character for other traits of this type.

### Familiar


### Flexible Ritualist
Your character casts **Rituals** in ways different from other mages. You may pick two Rituals and change which **Ability Score** is associated with **Checks** for casting those Rituals. You may choose **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, or **Charisma** for the **Invocation Checks**, and need not necessarily choose the same Ability Score for each ritual. You are not required to pick both Rituals when this trait is gained, and may instead “hold” some of your picks for later Rituals.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to different Rituals each time.

### Potent Magic
Your character picks two **Magical Arts** that she already knows.  **Saving Throws** to resist these magical arts are performed with **Disadvantage**.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to different Magical Arts each time.

### Practiced Ritual
Your mage has practiced and memorized a single ritual so many times, he may cast it without need of his spellbook or a scroll.  He still requires all other ritual ingredients.  This trait may be taken multiple times, each time applying to a different ritual.

### Skilled Caster
After a great deal of practice, your character has mastered a particular type of magic. Choose two **Magical Arts** known by your character; she gains +2 on all **Invocation Checks** for the Arts in question.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to different Magical Arts each time.

### Supreme Concentration
Your mage may **Concentrate** on 2 **Magical Arts** at the same time.  If an event will potentially break his Concentration, he must make a separate Concentration Check for each art.

### Touched by Magic
Some have a wild, untrained gift for the **Magic Arts**; others learn just a bit and then do not continue their studies.  Pick two **Cantrips** that your character can now cast.  Cantrips cast using this trait can not be upcast and this trait does **not** grant the character any Invocation Dice.

This **Trait** does nothing for spellcasting classes.  

This trait may be taken multiple times to learn additional cantrips.

### War Wizard
Through martial training and practice, your mage has learned how best to harness the destructive powers of magic. He may add his Ability Modifier to the damage of any **Magical Art** he casts.  The Ability Modifier used is the one named by the Magical Art itself.

### Well of Power
This mage may spend a **Fortune Point** to regain a number of lost **Invocation Dice** equal to the highest of her **Intelligence**, **Wisdom** or **Charisma** modifiers upon completing a **Short Rest**.

### With But a Wave
The caster picks two [spells](magic/Spells.md) or cantrips they already know. These [spells](magic/Spells.md) no longer require the caster be able to [Incant](magic/Spells.md#components) when casting them.

### Words of Power
The caster picks two [spells](magic/Spells.md) or cantrips they already know. These [spells](magic/Spells.md) no longer require the caster be able to [Gesture](magic/Spells.md#components) when casting them.

## Supernatural Traits

These are supernatural abilties that may be gained without the ability to use **magical arts** or swear and **allegiance** to a **cosmic power**.

### {Beast} Speech
Whether because of heritage, a mystical pact, or an unknown gift, your character has a great affinity with the named type of animal. She may speak with them, has a rough sense of when they are nearby, and gains **Advantage** on any **D20 Checks** involving them.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different animal type each time.

### Cat's Eyes
You gain the [Low-Light Vision](CoreRules.md#low-light%20vision) trait if you do not already have it.  If you do, you gain the [Darkvision](CoreRules.md#darkvision) trait.  If you already have Darkvision, this trait does nothing for you.

### Child of the {Terrain}
Pick a terrain type (such as forest, desert, ocean, mountain, etc).  Your character can never become lost in this terrain except by magical means.  Additionally, sometimes the spirits of the land in this terrain whisper to her and she gains **Advantage** on any **Charisma Check** to interact with such spirits.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different terrain type each time.

### {Elemental} Caller
Due to bloodline or oath, all manifested or aware elementals of the named type in Near range of your character must present themselves; socially if they are capable of speech, or wordlessly if they are not. Your character can perceive them even if they are invisible or inaudible.  He gains the appropriate elemental language as a bonus language.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different elemental type each time.

### Fae Touched
Your character has been exposed to the magic of Faerie or has fae blood running in their veins.  They gain a +2 bonus to any **Saving Throw** vs magic.  Additionally, at around mid-puberty, their aging tends to slow to half the normal rate for their species.  Characters that are already Fae Blooded (such as Dwarves, Elves and Goblins) cannot take this trait.

### Ghost-Touched
Your character is marked in some way by the dead. After the sun has set, he may see any ghosts in his presence. Note that this trait does not allow the character to see other types of invisible spirits.

### Healing Touch
Your character’s hands have the power to heal the sick and wounded. Your character may lay hands on another and grant them the same benefits as a **Short Rest** (though this does not count against the number of short rests they may take in a day).  Once this trait has been used, it cannot be used again until your character completes a **Long Rest**.  This trait may be taken multiple times, to gain additional uses of this ability (regaining only 1 use per Long Rest).

### Infuse Weapon
Your character may infuse part of her soul into her weapon attacks (including unarmed).  When she does so, her attacks are treated as magical for the next minute, after which she gains 1 level of **Exhaustion**.

### Oathkeeper
When your character witnesses an oath or makes one herself, fate binds the oath taker to see it done. Anyone who makes an oath in your character’s presence, including the character herself, must keep their word or find themselves halving all healing received and unable to regain **Fortune Points** unless they are working towards fulfilling their oath.

### Second Sight
Your character gains the [Sense Magic](classes/Spellcaster.md#sense%20magic) ability as if they were a Spellcaster.

### Shapechanger
Be it due to magic, a curse or an unnatural heritage, your character has the ability to take the shape of any one small, ordinary animal chosen at the time this trait is taken.  Doing so is very difficult and requires the expenditure of a Fortune Point. This change lasts for 1 hour per **Character Level**. Changing back earlier requires a **Difficulty 12 Spirit Save** or the expenditure of another **Fortune Point**.

### Soul Gaze
Your character has the frightening ability to look into another’s soul. When she first encounters any creature with a **True Name**, she may spend a **Fortune Point** to learn the creature’s **Allegiance** (if any) and **Type**.  Additionally, she may make a **Charisma Check** for a chance that the creature’s True Name will come to her that night in a dream.  The **DT** of the check is 10 + 1 per **Hit Die** of the target.

### Spirit Friend
For some reason, spirits are naturally disposed to like or obey your character. Perhaps he is more real to them than other physical beings, or has a mystical heritage of some sort. Your character gains **Advantage** on all social checks involving disembodied spirits and on all rolls to summon or bind them.
