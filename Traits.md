# Traits
Traits help set individual characters apart from one another, even if they are of the same species, class and general background.  Each trait represents some specific inborn ability or special training unique to that character.  They are different from Knacks in that they have no class requirements.

Each class abilties table shows when characters gain Traits.

Traits are broken into multiple distinct types: General, Allegiance, Combat, Spellcasting and Supernatural.

Unless otherwise noted, each trait may only be taken once.

### Breaker of [Allegiance]

This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different Allegiance each time.

## Combat Traits

These are traits which will directly improve the combat prowess of a given character, but are not so specialized as to require one to be a **Fighter**.  As a result, characters of any class may take these traits.

### Combat Mastery
This character’s skill at arms is unmatched. If her level is greater than the **Hit Dice** of her strongest opponent, she gains +2 on all to-hit rolls and +2 armor class.

### Crossbow Expert
This character has spent long hours practicing with crossbows.  Reloading a crossbow no longer takes an action, and your character can attack adjacent foes or fire into melee with their crossbow without penalty.

### Duelist
A character with this trait is skilled at fighting opponents in single combat. If your character is fighting any other single **small**, **medium** or **large** sized opponent in a one-on-one duel, he receives a +2 bonus to hit and a +2 bonus to armor class. These bonuses promptly disappear as soon as bystanders intervene.

### Favored Enemy
Your character bears a grudge toward a particular type of foe, such as goblins, wizards, or dragons.

### Off-Hand Proficiency
Your character may wield a medium one-handed weapon in her off-hand at the same time as she wields a medium one-handed weapon in her primary hand.  While doing so she gains a +1 bonus to both AC and to hit and may attack with either weapon.  See Fighting with Two Weapons for the normal rules.

### Panther’s Grace 
When unarmored, your character receives a +3 bonus to AC. He may still bear a shield or wear magical trinkets or jewelry and gain the benefits of this Trait.

### Unarmed Combat
Your character is dangerous even without a weapon in her hand. Her unarmed combat attacks do 1d6b damage.  This trait may be taken multiple times, increasing the unarmed damage die by one step each time (to a max of 1d10).

## Spellcasting Traits

Most of these **Traits** are only available to characters who possess the ability to utilize **Magical Arts**.  The exception is the [Touched by Magic](#touched-by-magic) trait, which will then qualify the character for other traits of this type.

### Familiar


### Flexible Ritualist
Your character casts **Rituals** in ways different from other mages. You may pick two Rituals and change which **Ability Score** is associated with **Checks** for casting those Rituals. You may choose **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, or **Charisma** for the **Invocation Checks**, and need not necessarily choose the same Ability Score for each ritual. You are not required to pick both Rituals when this trait is gained, and may instead “hold” some of your picks for later Rituals.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to different Rituals each time.

### Potent Magic
Your character picks two **Magical Arts** that she already knows.  **Saving Throws** to resist these magical arts are performed with **Disadvantage**.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to different Magical Arts each time.

### Practiced Ritual

### Skilled Caster
After a great deal of practice, your character has mastered a particular type of magic. Choose two **Magical Arts** known by your character; she gains +2 on all **Invocation Checks** for the Arts in question.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to different Magical Arts each time.

### Supreme Concentration
Your mage may **Concentrate** on 2 **Magical Arts** at the same time.  If an event will potentially break his Concentration, he must make a separate Concentration Check for each art.

### Touched by Magic
Some have a wild, untrained gift for the **Magic Arts**; others learn just a bit and then do not continue their studies.  Pick two **Cantrips**, 1 **Spell** or 1 **Ritutal** and your character can now cast them.  She has 2 **Invocation Dice** with which to invoke these one Magical Arts. Any Magical Art cast using this trait is always cast at its base **rank**.  

This **Trait** does nothing for spellcasting classes.  

This trait may be taken multiple times to learn additional magic but no additional Invocation Dice are gained.

This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different animal type each time.

### Child of the [Terrain]
Pick a terrain type (such as forest, desert, ocean, mountain, etc).  Your character can never become lost in this terrain except by magical means.  Additionally, sometimes the spirits of the land in this terrain whisper to her and she gains **Advantage** on any **Charisma Check** to interact with such spirits.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different terrain type each time.

### [Elemental] Caller
Due to bloodline or oath, all manifested or aware elementals of the named type in Near range of your character must present themselves; socially if they are capable of speech, or wordlessly if they are not. Your character can perceive them even if they are invisible or inaudible.  He gains the appropriate elemental language as a bonus language.  This trait may be taken multiple times, applying to a different elemental type each time.

### Fae Touched
Your character has been exposed to the magic of Faerie or has fae blood running in their veins.  They gain a +2 bonus to any **Saving Throw** vs magic.

Your character may lay hands on another and grant them the same benefits as a **Short Rest** (though this does not count against the number of short rests they may take in a day).  Once this trait has been used, it cannot be used again until your character completes a **Long Rest**.  This trait may be taken multiple times, to gain additional uses of this ability (regaining only 1 use per Long Rest).

### Infuse Weapon
Your character may infuse part of her soul into her weapon attacks (including unarmed).  When she does so, her attacks are treated as magical for the next minute, after which she gains 1 level of **Exhaustion**.

### Oathkeeper
When your character witnesses an oath or makes one herself, fate binds the oath taker to see it done. Anyone who makes an oath in your character’s presence, including the character herself, must keep their word or find themselves halving all healing received and unable to regain **Fortune Points** unless they are working towards fulfilling their oath.

### Second Sight
Your character gains the **Sense Magic** ability as if they were a [Spellcaster](Spellcaster.md#sense-magic).

### Soul Gaze
Your character has the frightening ability to look into another’s soul. When she first encounters any creature with a **True Name**, she may spend a **Fortune Point** to learn the creature’s **Allegiance** (if any) and **Type**.  Additionally, she may make a **Charisma Check** for a chance that the creature’s True Name will come to her that night in a dream.  The **DT** of the check is 10 + 1 per **Hit Die** of the target.

### Spirit Friend
