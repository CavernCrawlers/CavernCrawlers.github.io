## Class Abilities

### Exhausting Magic
You may recover expended **Invocation Dice** by gaining 1 level of **Exhaustion** per die after completing 10 minutes of meditation.

### Magical Focus
As part of your apprenticeship, you created a unique magical focus to aid in your spellcasting.  This focus may take most any form (a staff, wand, amulet or similar), but must be easily seen, recognized and hand-held.  So long as you have your Magical Focus, your **Invocation Dice** are only removed on rolls of 1, rather than 1 or 2.  A focus may be replaced by constructing a new one which takes 1 week in a safe haven and 50sp worth of materials.

### Magic User
You can harness the power of magic.  A mage begins their career knowing two cantrips.  You will need to select a **Magical Tradition** from which your spells will be drawn.  You may not cast a spell of a Tier higher than that shown on the table below.

### Sense Magic
Being naturally sensitive to the world of magic, you may determine if a person, place or thing is magical with a **Perception** check.  Doing so requires concentration and a few minutes; so you cannot tell if something is magical simply by being in its presence and people tend to notice when a mage is staring at them.  You can also attempt to decipher magical writing with an **Intelligence** check.

### True Name
As a magic-user possessing supernatural power, you have a **True Name**.  Those who know your True Name can use it against you.  By calling out your True Name, a creature gains **Advantage** on all actions taken against you, including attacks and you have **Disadvantage** on your **Invocation** checks to cast spells against them.

## Warrior-Mage Knacks

**Archer**: You do not have **Disadvantage** when making attacks at Far range.

**Cavalry**: While mounted, you gain +2 to hit and +1 AC.  Additionally, whatever creature you are mounted on gains +1 AC and +1 Evasion.

**Charger**: If you perform the **charge** maneuver, add +2 to your damage rolls.

**Cleave**: Immediately after one of your attacks drops a foe to 0 HP, you may make another attack.  If you have movement remaining, you may move between attacks.  This cannot be combined with the **Sweep** maneuver.

**Deadly Blow**: Your weapon damage die increases 1 step (d6 to d8, d8 to d10, etc).

**Precise Shot**: Ignore any cover bonuses your target has to their AC.

**Indomitable**: +1 to all **Defenses** except AC.

**Mighty Deeds**: Once per turn, when you make a melee attack, you may declare a Mighty Deed.  Describe the special effect you wish to add to your attack (such as disarming an opponent, tripping them, pushing them back, etc).  If the attack hits, and the die face is equal to or greater than your 14, the Mighty Deed succeeds.  Note that the Mighty Deed cannot add to the damage of the attack and the target's **Defenses** may apply.  This ability may be taken more than once, reducing the Mighty Deed target number by 2 each time.

**Shield Master**: While wielding a shield, you may add your shield bonus to your **Evasion Defense** and you increase your AC bonus from shields by +1.

**Skirmisher**: Gain +1 **Initiative**, +5 feet movement and +1 AC vs **Attacks of Opportunity** so long as you are not wearing _heavy_ armor.

**Weapon Specialization**:  Pick a weapon. Your character receives a +1 to hit and +2 damage bonus while wielding this weapon. If this talent is taken at 1st level, your character begins the game with this weapon for free.  This knack may be taken more than once, applying to a different weapon each time.
