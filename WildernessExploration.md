# Wilderness Exploration

## Wilderness Exploration Turn Sequence
1. Decide Direction: The party decides the direction they will travel for the next Watch.
2. Getting Lost: The GM rolls for the party getting lost.
3. Random Encounters: The GM makes checks as needed.
4. Description: The GM describes what the party encounters (terrain passed through, landmarks other points of interest).  The GM also asks the players for their actions as needed.  If other creatures are encountered, follow the procedure outlined in the Encounter rules.
5. End of Watch: The GM performs any needed record keeping: rations, fatigue, spell durations, etc.

## Travel Speed
When travelling overland, characters can travel their [Exploration Speed](Dungeoneering.md#exploration-speed) divided by five in miles per day.  Use the chart below for quick reference:

### Travel Speed Chart
| Base Move | Hour  | Watch  | Day  |
|:---------:|:-----:|-------:|:----:|
| 20ft      | 1.5ml |  6.0ml | 12ml |
| 25ft      | 1.9ml |  7.5ml | 15ml |
| 30ft      | 2.3ml |  9.0ml | 18ml |
| 35ft      | 2.6ml | 10.5ml | 21ml |
| 40ft      | 3.0ml | 12.0ml | 24ml |
| 45ft      | 3.4ml | 13.5ml | 27ml |
| 50ft      | 3.8ml | 10.0ml | 30ml |

### Terrain
Different types of terrain will modify the speed at which the party travels.
- **Rough (desert, forest, hills, etc):** 1/3 speed
- **Very Rough (jungle, mountain, swamp, etc):** 1/2 speed
- **Easy (well maintained roads):** 1.5x speed

Flying creatures ignore terrain penalties.

### Forced March
The above rules assume roughly 8 hours of travel with regular breaks for rest and food each day.  If needed, a party may perform a **Forced March** to travel further.  Forced Marches are always measured in hours (after 2 full [Watches](RulesSynopsis.md#time) of travel).  At the end of each hour, every member of the party must make am [Exhaustion Check](CoreRules.md#exhaustion) vs **DT 10** (+3 per additional hour after the first) or gain a level of [Exhaustion](Combat.md#Exhaustion).

### Double-Time
Another way to increase the rate of travel is to march at "double-time".  This increases the party's speed by 50%, but an [Exhaustion Check](CoreRules.md#exhaustion) must be made at the end of each hour of double-time movement.  This check is vs **DT 10** + 3 per consecutive hour.  If the check is failed, that party member gains a level of [Exhaustion](Combat.md#Exhaustion).  Anyone with any levels of **Exhaustion** may not march at double-time.

### Resting
For every 6 days of travel, one must be spent resting.  If the party forgoes this rest period, each party member must make an [Exhaustion Check](CoreRules.md#exhaustion) vs a **DT 13** + 3 per consecutive day of travel or gain a level of [Exhaustion](Combat.md#Exhaustion).  This is on top of any other checks for **Forced Marches** and **Double-Time**.

## Foraging and Hunting
During travel, the party may make a Skilled Wisdom check to find enough food for 1d6 characters.  This may not be done during a **Forced March** or **Double-Time** movement.
