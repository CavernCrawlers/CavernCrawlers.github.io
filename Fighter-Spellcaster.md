## Class Abilities

### Exhausting Magic
If you find yourself in need of a quick boost of magical energy, you may add your **Skill Bonus** to your **Invocation Roll** by gaining 1 level of [Exhaustion](Combat.md#Exhaustion).

### Invocation Dice
As a spellcaster, you have a number of invocation dice as indicated on the [Fighter-Spellcaster Table](#Fighter-Spellcaster-Table) plus additional dice equal to your **Wisdom Modifier**.

### Magical Focus
As part of your apprenticeship, you created a unique magical focus to aid in your spellcasting.  This focus may take most any form (a staff, wand, amulet or similar), but must be easily seen, recognized and hand-held.  It also takes up 1 inventory slot.  So long as you have your Magical Focus in hand when casting a spell, you may reroll a number of invocation dice equal to 1/3 your Skill Bonus (rounded up).  A focus may be replaced by constructing a new one which takes 1 week in a safe haven and 50sp worth of materials.

Spellcasters also frequently inscribe runes that they know into their spellcasting focus so that they are immediately on-hand when casting spells.

### Spellcasting
You can harness the power of magic.  A hybrid-spellcaster begins their career knowing two cantrips.  You may not cast a spell of a Tier higher than shown in the table below.

### Sense Magic
Being sensitive to the world of magic, you may determine if a person, place or thing is magical with a **Skilled** **Intelligence** check.  Doing so requires concentration and a full minute; so you cannot tell if something is magical simply by being in its presence and people tend to notice when a mage is staring at them.  You can also attempt to decipher magical writing in the same way.

### True Name
As a magic-user possessing supernatural power, you have a **True Name**.  Those who know your True Name can use it against you.  By calling out your True Name, a creature gains **Advantage** on all actions taken against you, including attacks and you have **Disadvantage** on your **Invocation** checks to cast spells against them.
