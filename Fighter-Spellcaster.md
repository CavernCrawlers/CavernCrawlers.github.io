## Fighter-Spellcaster Knacks

Unless stated otherwise, each knack may only be taken once.

**Archer**: You do not have **Disadvantage** when making attacks at Far range.

**Cavalry**: While mounted, you gain +2 to hit and +1 AC.  Additionally, whatever creature you are mounted on gains +1 AC and +1 Evasion.

**Charger**: If you perform the **charge** maneuver, add +2 to your damage rolls.

**Indomitable**: +1 to all **Saving Throws** except AC.
