This document contains a list of skills used in the <ins>**Cavern Crawlers**</ins> system.

## Skill Ranks
All skills are ranked in 4 levels: *Unskilled*, *Apprentice* *Expert* and *Master*.  The first time a skill is learned, it is taken at the *Apprentice* level.  Taking the same skill a second time raises it to *Expert* and a third raises it to *Master*.  The modifier from the table below is added to the character's [skill checks](CoreRules.md#skilled%20check).

## Skill List
### Athletics
Most any sort of physical endeavor such as acrobatics, climbing, lifting heavy objects, long distance running, swimming and the like.

### Deception

### Deduction
The skill of searching for clues and piecing them together. This skill is used for solving riddles and puzzles, deciphering codes and other feats of logic or intuition.

### Healing

### Intimidation
This skill is used in influencing people through threats and violence.

### Lockpick
The skill of opening locks; mechanical or puzzle.

### Lore
There is no single Lore skill. Instead, when learning this skill, a broad category of learning is selected (such as magic, history, religion, alchemy, etc).

### Perception
This skill represents training in searching, observing and other forms of detection.

### Persuasion
This skill is used to influence people with tact and diplomacy. It is frequently used in most forms of negotiation, such as trading, hiring or just plain convincing someone to help.

### Profession
This skill represents professional training in some area. Like the Lore skill, there is no one Profession skill. Instead the character learning this skill must specify an individual profession like blacksmithing, mason, teaching, mining, carpentry, and so on.

### Riding
This is a general skill in knowing how to keep a saddle and control a beast to be ridden. Even exotic beasts may be ridden with this skill, though *Disadvantage* may apply until the rider and beast become familiar with each other.

### Legerdemain
This skill is used for sleight of hand feats, such as picking pockets, palming a small object, slipping poison into a drink, and so forth.

### Stealth
This is the ability to remain unnoticed. A stealth check will always fail if the character attempting the check can be directly observed.

### Survival
This is training in how to survive in a specific environment.  Like [Lore](#lore) and [Profession](#profession), the type of environment (forest, desert, mountain, etc) should be selected when this skill is learned. A skilled character will know how to hunt, gather and find shelter in the given environment as well as how to navigate and track others.

### Trap Handling
The skill of setting or disarming mechanical traps.
