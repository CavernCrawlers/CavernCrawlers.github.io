# Skills
In addition to their ability scores, all characters will have at least 2 skills.  If a skill applies in a situation requiring a **D20 Check**, then a **Skilled Check** is made.  This is a normal **Ability Check**, with an additional +4 modifier.  Some characters are particularly skilled and gain a +6 modifier instead of a +4.  This is achieved by learning the same skill twice.  Skills never grant a bonus higher than +6

The following list contains skills that are deliberately broad to reflect the kind of broad competence seen in most heroic fiction.  In some cases, two different skills may seem to apply to a situation.  In that case, the player making the check determines which of their applicable skills is used.

**Athletics** – Most any sort of physical endeavor such as climbing, acrobatics, lifting heavy objects, long distance running, swimming and the like.

**Deduction** – The skill of searching for clues and piecing them together.  This skill is used for solving riddles and puzzles, deciphering codes and other feats of logic or intuition.

**Healing** – The healing skill applies to checks to stabilize downed creatures, identify poisons, diagnose diseases as well as how to treat such afflictions.  For additional details, see [Healing and Recovery](Healing_and_Recovery.md).

**Insight** – This is the skill of reading people.  The insight skill applies to checks to determine if someone is lying, judge a person’s mood or to find their motivation.

**Intimidation** – This skill is used in influencing people through threats and violence.

**Lore (subject)** – There is no single Lore skill.  Instead, when learning this skill, a broad category of learning is selected (such as magic, history, religion, alchemy, etc).

**Perception** – This skill represents training in searching, observing and other forms of detection.

**Persuasion** – This skill is used to influence people with tact and diplomacy.  It is frequently used in most forms of negotiation, such as trading, hiring or just plain convincing someone to help.

**Profession (type)** – This skill represents professional training in some area.  Like the Lore skill, there is no one Profession skill.  Instead the character learning this skill must specify an individual profession like blacksmithing, mason, teaching, mining, carpentry, and so on.

**Riding** – This is a general skill in knowing how to keep a saddle and control a beast to be ridden.  Even exotic beasts may be ridden with this skill, though **Disadvantage** may apply until the character and beast become familiar with each other.

**Skullduggery** – This is a catch-all skill for most things duplicitous: sleight of hand, pickpocketing, deception, misdirection, lock picking, and so on.

**Stealth** – This is the ability to move silently and hidden.  A stealth check will always fail if the character attempting the check can be directly observed.

**Survival (environment)** – This is training in how to survive in a particular environment.  A skilled character will know how to find food, water and shelter in the given environment as well as how to navigate and track others.
