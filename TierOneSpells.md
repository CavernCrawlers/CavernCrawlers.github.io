Any undead creature within Near range of the caster, who can see or hear the caster, must immediately make a **Spirit** saving throw or become [Frightened](Combat.md#Frightened) of the caster.  Affected creatures may repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns in order to overcome the effect.  Once the effect is overcome or the duration has expired, the affected creatures behave normally.
