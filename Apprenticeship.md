# Apprenticeships
## Background Apprenticeship
Everyone did something before they became an adventurer. Roll (1d100) or select from the following table to determine what it was your character was going to do before being thrust into a life of adventure. This will determine some of your character's starting equipment.  Your character is automatically proficient with any weapon provided by their apprentice occupation, but not the entire weapon group.

The column used for the roll should be chosen based on the culture in which your character was raised.
