# Downtime Activities
As an optional rule, it is possible for characters to partake in various downtime activities that will give PCs potential benefits.  The activities that may be undertaken are [Carousing](#Carousing), [Extended Rest](Combat.md#Extended%20Rest), [Study](#Study), [Training](#Training), [Worship](#Worship), [Work](#Work) or [Other](#other%20downtime%20activities).  Which activity a PC chooses to partake in is up to the player in question.  Different methods can offer different boons but also come with different risks.

It is recommended that downtime be taken in weeks and that is what the below rules assume.  If there is less time available, the GM should work out what needs to be changed and how much can be accomplished.  Only one downtime activity may be taken per week.

Downtime activities are not free to perform.  **Extended Rests** only incur **Lifestyle Expense** costs.  **Carousing**, **Study**, **Training** and **Worship** each cost money on top of the Lifestyle Expense chosen by the player.  The exact amount of money spent on these activities is up to the player, taking into account the settlement type limits of the [safe haven](Combat.md#Extended%20Rest) they are at (and these activities can only be pursued in a safe haven).  The more money spent, the bigger the bonus on the table coinciding with the activity taken.  What this money goes to depends on the type of activity (alcohol and gambling for carousing, training fees for training, church tithes for worship, etc).

## Downtime Spending
| Cost    | Bonus | Minimum Settlement Size |
|:-------:|:-----:|:------------------------|
|    20sp |   +0  | Village                 |
|    40sp |   +1  | Village                 |
|    80sp |   +2  | Village                 |
|   150sp |   +3  | Town                    |
|   300sp |   +4  | Town                    |
|   600sp |   +5  | City                    |
| 1,200sp |   +6  | City                    |

Each type of activity (except **Extended Rest** and **Other**) grants the character a chance to earn a boon but may also incur a bane depending on the roll.

## Carousing
The character chooses to celebrate their victories (or drown their sorrows) with wine, song and (possibly) companionship.  Each participant decides how much silver they wish to spend in their celebrations; the more money spent, the more lavish the revelries.  This provides a modifier that is applied to a die roll to determine the outcome of the weekâ€™s carousing.  Roll 1d20 + your **Charisma modifier** + your **Spending Bonus** on the **Carousing Results** table.
