## Class Abilities

### Hauler
You add your **Constitution Modifier** (if positive) to your **Strength Score** for determining your **Encumbrance** limits.

### Mighty Deed
Once per turn, when you make a melee attack, you may declare a Mighty Deed.  Describe the special effect you wish to add to your attack (such as disarming an opponent, tripping them, pushing them back, etc).  If the attack hits, and the die face is equal to or greater than your Mighty Deed target number, the Mighty Deed succeeds.  Note that the Mighty Deed cannot add to the damage of the attack and the target's **Saving Throws** may apply.

### Minimum Damage
Warriors are experts at dealing damage.  If your attack misses the target's AC by less than your level, you still deal your attack's minimum damage to the target.

## Warrior Knacks

**Archer**: You do not have **Disadvantage** when making attacks at Far range.

**Armored**: Gain +1 AC while wearing armor.  Also reduce the damage taken from non-magical blunt, cutting and penetrating damage based on the weight of the armor worn (1 for Light, 2 for Medium or 3 for Heavy).

**Berserk**: For the duration of one combat, gain +2 on **Strength Checks**, melee **Attack Rolls**, melee **Damage Rolls** and **Spirit Defense**, but suffer -4 to AC.  After the combat ends, gain a level of **Exhaustion**.  You cannot use this Knack while you have any levels of Exhaustion.

**Cavalry**: While mounted, you gain +2 to hit and +1 AC.  Additionally, whatever creature you are mounted on gains +1 AC and +1 Evasion.

**Charger**: If you perform the **charge** maneuver, add +2 to your damage rolls.

**Cleave**: Immediately after one of your attacks drops a foe to 0 HP, you may make another attack.  If you have movement remaining, you may move between attacks.  This cannot be combined with the **Sweep** maneuver.

**Deadly Blow**: Your weapon damage die increases 1 step (d6 to d8, d8 to d10, etc).

**Exploit Weakness**:  Reduce the required _Natural_ value for a critical hit on your attacks by 1.  This knack may be taken up to 3 times.  For instance, taking this knack twice means you would only need a natural 18+.

**Great Weapon Fighter:** When wielding a Heavy 2-handed weapon, any damage dice that show a 1 or 2 may be re-rolled.  Take the higher result.						

**Indomitable**: +1 to all **Saving Throws**.

**Mighty Shot**: You may use your Mighty Deed ability with ranged attacks.

**Precise Shot**: Ignore any cover bonuses your target has to their AC.

**Reckless**: When you choose to use this ability, all your attacks that **Round** have **Advantage**.  All attacks against you also have **Advantage** until the start of your next **Turn**.

**Shield Master**: While wielding a shield, you may add your shield bonus to your **Evasion Defense** and you increase your AC bonus from shields by +1.

**Skirmisher**: Gain +1 **Initiative**, +5 feet movement and +1 AC vs **Attacks of Opportunity** so long as you are not wearing _heavy_ armor.

**Weapon Specialization**:  Pick a weapon. Your character receives a +1 to hit and +2 damage bonus while wielding this weapon. If this talent is taken at 1st level, your character begins the game with this weapon for free.  This knack may be taken more than once, applying to a different weapon each time.
