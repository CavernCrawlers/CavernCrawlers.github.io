## Class Abilities
### Hauler
You add your **Constitution Modifier** (if positive) to your **Strength Score** for determining your **Encumbrance** limits.

### Mighty Deed
Once per turn, when you make a melee attack, you may declare a Mighty Deed.  Describe the special effect you wish to add to your attack (such as disarming an opponent, tripping them, pushing them back, etc).  If the attack hits, and the die face is equal to or greater than your Mighty Deed target number, the Mighty Deed succeeds.  Note that the Mighty Deed cannot add to the damage of the attack and the target's **Defenses** may apply.

### Minimum Damage 
The amount listed as your **Damage Bonus** is not just the damage you add on weapon attacks.  This value is also the minimum amount of damage you will do on a missed attack, assuming the target’s AC is not higher than the listed AC.  *For example, a 6th level warrior will do 3 damage on a missed attack so long as the target’s AC is 13 or less.  Your normal damage modifiers also apply to this damage.*

### Weapon Specialization
All warriors have weapons they favor and with which they are particularly skilled.  Pick a weapon at first level.  Your character receives a +1 to hit and +2 damage bonus while wielding this weapon.  You begin play with this weapon for free.
