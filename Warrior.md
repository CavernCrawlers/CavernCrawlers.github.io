### Damage Bonus
Warriors are experts at dealing damage.  This bonus is added to the damage of all attacks they make.

### Hauler
You add your **Constitution Modifier** (if positive) to your **Strength Score** for determining your **Encumbrance** limits.

### Mighty Deed
Once per turn, when you make a melee attack, you may declare a Mighty Deed.  Describe the special effect you wish to add to your attack (such as disarming an opponent, tripping them, pushing them back, etc).  If the attack hits, and the die face is equal to or greater than your Mighty Deed target number, the Mighty Deed succeeds.  Note that the Mighty Deed cannot add to the damage of the attack and the target's **Defenses** may apply.

### Weapon Specialization
All warriors have weapons they favor and with which they are particularly skilled.  Pick a weapon at first level.  Your character receives a +1 to hit and +2 damage bonus while wielding this weapon.  You begin play with this weapon for free.

## Warrior Knacks

**Archer**: You do not have **Disadvantage** when making attacks at Far range.

**Armored**: Gain +1 AC while wearing armor.

**Berserk**: For the duration of one combat, gain +2 on **Strength Checks**, melee **Attack Rolls**, melee **Damage Rolls** and **Spirit Defense**, but suffer -4 to AC.  After the combat ends, gain a level of **Exhaustion**.  You cannot use this Knack while you have any levels of Exhaustion.  This can only be used with a **Normal Stance**.

**Cavalry**: While mounted, you gain +2 to hit and +1 AC.

**Charger**: If you perform the charge maneuver, add +2 to your damage rolls.

**Deadly Blow**: Your weapon damage die increases 1 step (d6 to d8, d8 to d10, etc).

**Exploit Weakness**:  Reduce the required Natural value for a critical hit on your attacks by 1.  This knack may be taken up to 3 times.  For instance, taking this knack twice means you would only need a natural 18+.
