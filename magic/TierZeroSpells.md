## Beast Speech
- **Tier:** Cantrip (0+)
- **Sigils** Beast
- **Casting Ability:** Charisma
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Area:** Self
- **Duration:** 1 Hour
- **Save:** None
- **Components:** Incantations

Each time a mage learns this cantrip, they must pick a particular type of beast to which it will apply (such as canines, ursines, birds, felines, snakes, etc).  Once cast, the mage will gain the ability to converse with that type of beast for the cantrip's duration.  Interactions with these beasts follow the general rules for social interactions (regarding [reaction rolls](CoreRules.md#Charisma%20and%20Reactions), diplomacy and so forth).  However, it should be kept in mind that most normal beasts don’t have the same concerns or social norms.  Communication does not necessarily convey understanding.

## Beguilement
- **Tier:** Cantrip (0+)
- **Sigils** A form sigil matching the type of the target creature.
- **Casting Ability:** Charisma
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Near
- **Area:** 1 Creature
- **Duration:** 10 Minutes
- **Save:** Spirit
- **Components:** Incantations

A mage uses this spell to influence the emotions and attitudes of the target creature.  If the target succeeds on their **saving throw**, they are unaffected but know that the caster was attempting to influence their mind with magic.  If the target fails, their emotional state moves toward the emotion selected by the caster (and may potentially cause a Morale check).  This can grant a plus or minus 1 modifier on social checks, including rolls on the [Reaction Table](CoreRules.md#Charisma%20and%20Reactions) and Moral checks.

As soon as the task is attempted, or if the duration expires without an attempt, the hexing fades.

## Mend
- **Tier:** 0 (cantrip)
- **Sigils** A form or elemental sigil matching the target type.
- **Casting Ability:** Wisdom
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Area:** 1 Creature or a Tiny area
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Save:** none
- **Components:** Gestures & Incantations

By means of this spell, the mage uses the power of a sigil to heal or mend a given object.  The sigil selected when casting this spell must match the target type (Humanoid for healing a sapient being, Beast to heal an animal, Earth to mend a stone wall, etc).

If used to heal a living being, this spell will heal 1 HP.

If used on an inanimate object, 1 Tiny area of material will be made whole.  This area may be increased by 1 category per +1 rank.  Thus, to mend a cut hemp rope, the mage would apply the Plant sigil at rank zero.  To mend a 10 x 10 x 5 foot section of castle wall (500 cubic feet) would require casting the spell at Rank 3 (for a Large area of effect) using the Earth sigil.
