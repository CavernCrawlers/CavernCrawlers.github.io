## Spellbooks
Spellcasters record their [spells](magic/Spells.md) and cantrips in "spellbooks".  These do not have to be literal books, but rather may be collections of scrolls, arcane formula carved into wood or most any other device the player and GM can agree on.  The primary limitation is that the spellbook be separate from the character (arcane tattoos are more of a magical item than a spellbook).  The language in which [spells](magic/Spells.md) are written are typically a magical cipher learned from the caster's teacher and modified in their own way.  As such, deciphering someone else's spellbook can be a long and arduous process.

A typical spellbook costs 100sp and can hold up to 100 pages worth of [spells](magic/Spells.md).
### Learning New Spells
New [spells](magic/Spells.md) take hours, days or weeks to properly learn.  While learning a new spell, the mage may take part in no other form of [downtime activity](Downtime.md); all their working hours being consumed with study and preparation.

When learning a new spell, it must be recorded in the mage’s spellbook.  Each spell takes up the number of pages shown on the following table.  For each page a spell takes up, it also takes 10 hours and 100sp worth of study and materials to properly learn and record the spell.

Once the calculated learning time has passed, the mage makes an Intelligence+[Lore(Magic)](Skills.md#lore) roll with a Diff equal to 10 plus the spell's base [Tier](Spells.md#tier).  Failure results in the loss of all time and materials used in the attempt and the mage may not attempt to learn this spell again until they’ve gained a new level.

#### Learning From a Mentor
Spellcasters may also learn [spells](magic/Spells.md) from other casters (if they can find one willing to teach their jealously guarded secrets).  The teacher is assumed to be taking the [Help](Combat.md#Main%20Actions) action in regards to the student learning the spell.  This also halves the amount of time required to learn the spell (though the material cost remains the same).

### Replacing a Spellbook
If a spellbook is lost or destroyed, it may be recreated using the [spells](magic/Spells.md) that the spellcaster already has [Prepared](#preparing%20spells).  Doing so requires a new [spellbook](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#Gear) and takes the same cost in time and materials as learning each spell anew.

#### Backup Spellbooks
With the amount of time and expense required to replace a lost spellbook (not to mention the loss of any spells not already prepared), it is no wonder that spellcasters often keep backup copies of their spellbooks hidden away somewhere safe.  The creation of a backup spellbooks is quicker and more certain than trying to recreate a lost spellbook from memory as you've simply copying rather than re-creating.  It only take 1 hour and 50sp per page in the spellbook to create a copy as you don't have to do all of the study and preparation.

## Magical Focus
A magical focus is a device that aids a spellcaster in channeling and controlling their magic.  This device must be easily seen, recognized and hand-held.  It also takes up 1 [inventory slot](EncumbranceAndEquipment#encumbrance).

### Sigils
A spellcaster may inscribe a number of Sigils into their focus equal to their [Caster Level](Glossary.md#caster%20level). Each Sigil represents a specific spell they have learned (i.e. recorded in their [Spellbook](#spellbooks)). Whenever s caster casts one of these spells, while their Magical Focus is in hand, the player rolls d8s for their [Invocation Dice](#the%20invocation%20roll) instead of d6s.

This explains why highly-skilled mages are always carrying around staffs, more room for sigils.

#### Inscribing Sigils
It takes 1 Day and 50sp times the spell's *Tier* to engrave a new Sigil into your focus.

### Replacing a Focus
A focus may be replaced by constructing a new one which takes 1 week in a [safe haven](Rest_and_Recovery.md#safe%20haven) and 100sp worth of materials.  This is a blank focus with no [Sigils](#sigils).

## Preparing Spells
A spellcaster may only cast [spells](magic/Spells.md) they have prepared.  Spells take time to prepare.  A spellcasters may only prepare as many spells as shown on their Class Table, plus additional *Tier 1* spells equal to their Intelligence Modifier. Preparing a spell takes 15 minutes times the spell's [Tier](magic/Spells.md#tier).  Once a spell is prepared, it remains prepared until the caster chooses to replace it with a different spell or some event causes the mage to temporarily lose the spell.

### Preparation Time
| Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 | Tier 5 | Tier 6 |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| 15m    | 30m    | 45m    | 60m    | 75m    | 90m    |

### Casting Unprepared Spells
A spellcaster, so long as they have access to their spellbook, may cast unprepared [spells](magic/Spells.md) using said spellbook.  Doing so increases the casting time of the spell [1 step](CoreRules.md#time%20steps), to a minimum of 10 minutes.  Spells cast in this way do not benefit from the [Sigils](#sigils) carved into a [Magical Focus](#magical%20focus).

*For example, a character wishing to cast [Augury](magic/TierTwoSpells.md#augury) as an unprepared spell must have their spellbook on hand.  Since the base casting time is 10 minutes, it will now take 1 hour to cast the spell in this manner.*

## The Invocation Roll

With thanks to the [Spell Dice](https://www.necropraxis.com/2013/11/01/spell-dice/) system by Necropraxis.

### Quick Summary
- Spellcasters get an [invocation pool](#the%20invocation%20dice%20pool) of six-sided dice based on their [Caster Level](Glossary.md#caster%20level) and Wisdom Modifier.
- Any number of dice may be used to cast a spell.
- [Spell difficulty](#spell%20difficulty) is equal to the spell’s [tier](magic/Spells.md#tier) times 3.
- Any **Invocation Die** that that roll a [natural](CoreRules.md#natural%20roll) 1 or 2 is removed from the pool (aka *Expended*).
- Some expended *Invocation dice* may be recovered after a [rest](Rest_and_Recovery.md).

### The Invocation Dice Pool
A spellcaster gets a pool of six-sided dice with which to cast their [spells](magic/Spells.md).  The total number of dice in the pool is based on the character’s [Caster Level](Glossary.md#caster%20level) plus additional dice equal to their *Wisdom Modifier*.

*Example: A 5th level [Spellcaster](classes/Spellcaster.md) with a 16 Wisdom (+2 modifier) has a pool of 7d6 <u>Invocation Dice</u>.*

When casting a spell, the caster may choose to roll any number of *Invocation Dice* in order to try to meet or exceed the [Spell Difficulty](#spell%20difficulty).  Any dice rolling a [Natural](CoreRules.md#natural%20roll) ‘1’ or ‘2’ are *Expended* from the pool (though still counted toward the casting result) and cannot be used again until *Recovered*.

#### Exhausting Magic
If a spellcaster finds themselves in need of a quick boost of magical energy, they may add half their [Caster Level](Glossary.md#caster%20level) to their *Invocation Roll* by gaining 1 level of [Exhaustion](Conditions.md#Exhaustion).  This may be done as a [Free Action](Combat.md#free%20actions).

#### Magical Focus
While a spellcaster has their [Magical Focus](#magical%20focus) is in hand, and if that focus has the proper [Sigils](#sigils) carved into it, the spellcaster may roll d8s instead of d6s for their *Invocation Dice*.

*Example: A 5th level [Spellcaster](classes/Spellcaster.md) wishes to cast the "fireball spell" (aka [Arcane Eruption (fire)](magic/TierThreeSpells.md#Arcane%20Eruption)) (Tier 3), so the difficulty is 9+.  Normally, they would roll up to 5d6 to cast the spell (probably using 3 to be on the safe side).  However, if they have the <u>Arcane Eruption (fire)</u> [Sigil](#sigils) carved into their <u>Magical Focus</u>, they would roll d8s and thus would be reasonably safe rolling only 2 dice to cast the spell (thus reducing the chance of a [Mishap](#mishaps)).*

### Spell Difficulty
A spell’s **difficulty** is equal to 3 times the [tier](magic/Spells.md#tier) at which it is cast.

*Example: A character casting [Arcane Arrow](magic/TierOneSpells.md#arcane%20arrow) at <u>Tier</u> 3 must beat a Spell Difficulty of 9 (3x3).*

If a spell’s *Difficulty* is not met, the spell is not cast.  However, the mage may choose to continue casting the spell.  This requires that the mage reserve the dice already used in casting the spell and [Concentrate](Conditions.md#Concentrating) long enough to satisfy the spell’s [Casting Time](magic/Spells.md#casting%20time) again.  Once this time increment has passed, the mage may choose to roll additional [Invocation Dice](#the%20invocation%20dice%20pool) and add their total to the *Spellcasting Roll*.  In this way, more difficult [Spells](magic/Spells.md) can be cast over multiple “rounds”.

*Example: The above 5th level [Spellcaster](classes/Spellcaster.md) with a 16 Wisdom is attempting to cast a ["fireball"](magic/TierThreeSpells.md#arcane%20eruption) at **Tier** 3 (difficulty 9).  They choose to be conservative and roll only 3 dice, rolling a ‘1’, '3' and ‘4’, for a total of 8.  As the total is less than the **difficulty**, the spell is not cast.  The character chooses to continue the casting. This means they are now **concentrating** and they set aside the 3 dice already rolled, leaving 4 left unallocated in their **invocation pool**.  On their next round (since the spell has a **casting time** of 1 **action**), they choose to roll one more die, getting another ‘1’.  This brings their total to 9, successfully casting the spell.  The two ‘1’s are now **expended**, and the other three committed dice are now released.  This leaves the caster with 5 dice in their **invocation pool**.  Note that no [Mishap](#Mishaps) roll is made because the two '1's occurred on two separate rolls.*

### Invocation Dice Recovery
Whenever a spellcaster completes a [Short Rest](Rest_and_Recovery.md#Short%20Rest), they may roll a portion of their *Expended* [Invocation Dice](#the%20invocation%20dice%20pool).  Any of those dice that come up a 2+ are placed back into the caster’s *Invocation Pool*.  The number of dice that may be rolled after a short rest is equal to their *Wisdom Modifier*.

After a [Long Rest](Rest_and_Recovery.md#Long%20Rest), the same procedure is followed with the following 2 exceptions:
- A number of dice equal to the character’s *Wisdom Modifier* are recovered without rolling.
- The caster may then roll all their remaining *Expended* *Invocation Dice**.

After an [Extended Rest](Rest_and_Recovery.md#Extended%20Rest), all *Invocation Dice* that have been *Expended* are automatically recovered.

## Magical Attacks and Saving Throws
Once a spell has successfully been *Invoked*, the mage may then need to make a *Magical Attack Roll*.  This is similar to a normal [Attack Roll](Combat.md#attacking%20an%20enemy), but uses the *Ability Modifier* of the ability called out by the Spell's description.  If the *Magical Attack Roll* is a critical hit, it allows the mage to double one numerical trait of the Spell; typically range, area, number of targets, duration or damage.  In the case of damage, treat this the same as a [critical hit](Combat.md#Critical%20Hits) from a weapon; only the spell's damage dice (not any other modifiers) are doubled.

Frequently, a spell will require the target to make a [Saving Throw](CoreRules.md#Saving%20Throw) instead of requiring a caster to make an *Attack Roll*.  In this case, the caster's [Spell Save Difficulty](classes/ClassAbilities.md#spellcasting) is the target number.  If the target succeeds on their save, the effects of the spell may be reduced or even mitigated entirely (according to the spell's description).

## Spell Identification
If a mage can directly see and hear another spellcaster as they cast a spell, they may attempt an Intelligence+[Lore (Magic)](Skills.md#lore) check vs. the spell's [Casting Difficulty](#spell%20difficulty) in order to identify the spell being cast.  If the observing mage can only see or hear the casting mage, but not both, this check is performed at *Disadvantage*.

If the check is successful and the mage has the spell in their spellbook, they completely identify the spell and whether or not it is being [upcast](magic/Spells.md#Upcasting) and to what [Tier](magic/Spells.md#tier).

If the check is successful but the mage does not have the spell in their spellbook, they will only be able to discern the following:
1. Whether or not the spell is being cast at a *Tier* the observing mage can cast.
2. What the spell's governing Ability is (Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma)
3. Whether the spell is offensive, defensive or utilitarian in nature.

If the check is failed, the observing mage gains no information.

Characters without the [Sense Magic](classes/ClassAbilities.md#sense%20magic) ability may not attempt this check at all.

## Concentration
Several [Spells](magic/Spells.md) require [Concentration](Conditions.md#concentrating) to maintain their effects after casting.  A caster may normally only *Concentrate* on one thing at a time.  New actions requiring *Concentration* supersede anything the caster is already *Concentrating* on.  If a *Concentrating* caster takes damage, they must pass a [Concentration Check](Glossary.md#concentration%20check) (a type of [Spirit Saving Throw](CoreRules.md#saving%20throw)) vs difficulty 9 plus the Spell's [Tier](magic/Spells.md#tier) or half the damage done (whichever is higher).  Other things may also require a *Concentration Check*, such as being thrown into a river, suddenly startled, being grappled and so on.  The GM will set the [Difficulty](CoreRules.md#difficulty) of the check accordingly.  Additionally, [Spells](magic/Spells.md) that take more than 1 action to cast require *Concentration* while they are being cast.  Losing *Concentration* causes the [Invocation Roll](#the%20invocation%20roll) to fail (though the declared number of *Invocation Dice* must still be rolled to see if a [Mishap](#mishaps) occurs and how many are *Expended*).

## Mishaps
If two of the dice rolled at the same time come up as [Natural](CoreRules.md#natural%20roll) ‘1’s, this will result in a [Minor Magical Mishap](#Minor%20Magical%20Mishap), even if the [Invocation Roll](#the%20invocation%20roll) is successful.  If three of the dice are *Natural* 1’s, then the caster suffers a [Major Magical Mishap](#Major%20Magical%20Mishap).  If four or more dice are *Natural* ‘1’s, then the caster suffers the effects of both a *Minor* and a *Major* magical mishap.

Note that some groups may wish to assume that [Spells](magic/Spells.md) cast when there is no time pressure (thus the caster can take as long as they want) are assumed to be rolled a single die at a time.  As a result, no mishap can occur, though dice can still be *Expended* as normal.
