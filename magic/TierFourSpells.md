The trance lasts the full casting time and the caster is treated as [unconscious](Combat.md#unconscious) for the duration.

The caster may ask the GM a single "yes" or "no" question that must be answered truthfully.

Each time this spell is cast within a 24-hour period increases the casting difficulty by +6.
