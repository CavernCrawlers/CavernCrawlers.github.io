If the arrow is not loosed before the spell's duration expires, the arrow is lost.

Additional arrows may be conjured at a rate of +1 arrow per +1 Tier. Each arrow may be targeted at a different creature and may be of any elemental sigil the mage knows.

Once all arrows are loosed, or the spell's duration expires, the spell ends.
