Encounters happen whenever the party encounters and unexpected group of creatures, obstacle or other such phenomena.  In the case of a creature encounter, follow the below procedure.

## Encounter Procedure
1. Surprise: The GM and players roll for surprise (if applicable).
2. Distance: The GM decides how far apart the two groups start.
3. Initiative: Each side that is not surprised compares initiative.
4. Actions: Each unsurprised side decides how they will react.

## Surprise
[Surprise](Combat.md#Surprise) only needs to be checked when one or more sides are not expecting the encounter.  For example, if a group of bandits spot the player party torches moving through the woods at night, the bandits do not roll for surprise, but the player party does.

### Light
A party carrying torches or other light sources in a dark environment cannot surprise sighted creatures.

## Encounter Distance
The environment determines the distance between the parties involved in the encounter.
- Dungeons and other dense terrain (jungle, heavy forest, etc): 2d6x10 feet
- Obscured wilderness (light forest, swamp, hills, etc): 2d6x10 yards or 1d4x10 yards if one full side is surprised.
- Clear wilderness (plains, open water, etc): 4d6x10 yards or 1d4x10 yards if one full side is surprised.

## Initiative
See the [Combat](Combat.md#initiatve) rules for the full details on initiative.

## Actions
The players decide how their own characters will act.

The GM will determine the actions of any NPCs.  Sometimes this will be obvious (a guard confronting intruders with demands for identification of person and purpose).  Other times, the GM should use the [Reaction Table](CoreRules.md#charisma-and-reactions) to determine how the NPCs respond.

### Common Actions
Almost anything is possible during an encounter but below are a few of the most likely possibilities.
- **Combat:** If at least one side decides to attack, proceed with the [Combat](Combat.md) rules.
- **Evasion:** If one party decides to flee and the other pursue, proceed to the Evasion rules.
- **Parley:** If both side decide to talk, role-play out the negotiations.
