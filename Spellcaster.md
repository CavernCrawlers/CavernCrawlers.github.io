## Class Abilities

### Exhausting Magic
You may recover expended **Invocation Dice** by gaining 1 level of **Exhaustion** per die after completing 10 minutes of meditation.

### Magical Focus
As part of your apprenticeship, you created a unique magical focus to aid in your spellcasting.  This focus may take most any form (a staff, wand, amulet or similar), but must be easily seen, recognized and hand-held.  So long as you have your Magical Focus in hand when casting a spell, you may add your **Skill Bonus** to your **Invocation Dice** total.  A focus may be replaced by constructing a new one which takes 1 week in a safe haven and 50sp worth of materials.

### Spellcasting
You can harness the power of magic.  A mage begins their career knowing two cantrips and two spells.  You will need to select a **Magical Tradition** from which your spells will be drawn.  You may not cast a spell of a Rank higher than shown in the table below.  Your spells have a **Saving Throw DT** equal to the DT shown on the table below plus the spell's listed **Ability Score Modifier**.

### Sense Magic
Being sensitive to the world of magic, you may determine if a person, place or thing is magical with a **Skilled** **Intelligence** check.  Doing so requires concentration and a few minutes; so you cannot tell if something is magical simply by being in its presence and people tend to notice when a mage is staring at them.  You can also attempt to decipher magical writing in the same way.

### True Name
As a magic-user possessing supernatural power, you have a **True Name**.  Those who know your True Name can use it against you.  By calling out your True Name, a creature gains **Advantage** on all actions taken against you, including attacks and you have **Disadvantage** on your **Invocation** checks to cast spells against them.
