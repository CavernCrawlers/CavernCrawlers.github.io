## Spell Descriptions

All spell descriptions contain the following information.

### Tier
This is the minimum Tier at which the spell must be cast.

### Runes
Which rune(s) are required for the casting of the spell.

### Casting Ability
This identifies which **Ability Score Modifier** (Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma) is used to compute the **Saving Throw DT** or **Attack Modifier** of any spells you cast.

### Casting Time
This is the minimum amount of time it takes to successfully cast a spell.  If a spell takes multiple rolls to cast, each roll is made at the end of each increment of **Casting Time**.

### Range
Spells use the same values as are used for ranged weapons:<br/>
**(C)lose** - (5ft)<br/>
**(N)ear** - (30ft)<br/>
**(F)ar** - (150ft)<br/>
**(S)ight** - Within Line of Sight (LoS)<br/>
**(D)istant** - Beyond perception

Two additional ranges are also added:<br/>
**(T)ouch** – magical arts with a range of touch require the caster to physically touch the subject.  Unwilling targets require an **Attack Roll** vs the target's **AC**.<br/>
**(P)ersonal** – This spell will only affect the caster.

Unless otherwise noted, any spell with a range of **Near**, **Far**, **Sight** or **Distant**, that requires an **Attack Roll**, will suffer **Disadvantage** on that Attack Roll if cast within **Close** range of an enemy.

Unless otherwise noted, any spell cast at a range of **Far** or greater, that requires an **Attack Roll** will suffer **Disadvantage** on that attack roll.

### Area
This is the area over which the magical art’s effects can be felt:<br/>
**Self** – Affects the caster only.<br/>
**Creature/Object** – Affects the targeted creature(s) or object(s) only.<br/>
**Tiny** – Affects an area no larger than 216 cubic inches (a 6x6x6 inch cube).<br/>
**Small** – Affects an area no larger than 27 cubic feet (3x3x3 feet).<br/>
**Medium** – Affects an area no larger than 125 cubic feet (5x5x5 feet).<br/>
**Large** – Affects an area up to 1,000 cubic feet (10x10x10 feet).<br/>
**Huge** – Affects an area up to 8,000 cubic feet (20x20x20).<br/>
**Gargantuan** – Affects an area up to 6,400 cubic feet (40x40x40).<br/>
**Other** – Has a different area of effect outlined in the magical art’s description.<br/>

### Duration
This indicates how long a spell will continue to affect the target(s).  Additionally, spells whose duration is marked with a (c) indicate that [Concentration](MagicalArts.md#Concentration) is required to maintain the magic.
- 1 Reaction
- 1 Action
- 1 Round
- 1 Minute
- 1 Exploration Turn (10 minutes)
- 1 Hour
- 1 Watch (4 hours)
- 1 Day
- 1 Week
- 1 Month
- 1 Year
- double the number of years for each additional step.

### Save
This indicates if a target is allowed to make a [Saving Throw](CoreRules.md#Saving-Throws) to resist or diminish the effect.  This will be given as a saving throw type.

### Components
Spells will often require **Gestures**, **Incantations** or both to cast.  If any one element is missing or restricted, the spell cannot be cast and any [Invocation Roll](MagicalArts.md#the-invocation-roll) will automatically fail.
- **Gestures** require at least one free hand (though it may be holding your Magical Focus or Rune).
- **Incantations** require the caster be able to speak freely and not be in a zone of total silence.

## Upcasting
Several spells allow the caster to increase the **rank** at which the spell is cast in return for enhanced effects.  Doing so increases the **Spellcasting DT** of the spell to match the new rank.  No spell may be cast at a rank higher than that to which the spellcaster has access.  

*For example, a 5th level Spellcaster may not cast any spells at a rank higher than 3.*
