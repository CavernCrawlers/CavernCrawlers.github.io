# Spells
Within this section you will find a list of spells for use in the *Cavern Crawlers* game.  This list is by no means definitive and the GM and players should work together if they wish to bring spells from other sources into the game.

## Spell Descriptions

All spell descriptions contain the following information.

### Casting Ability
This identifies which **Ability Score Modifier** (Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma) is used to compute the **Saving Throw DT** or **Attack Modifier** of any spells you cast.

### Casting Time
This is the minimum amount of time it takes to successfully cast a spell.  If a spell takes multiple rolls to cast, each roll is made at the end of each increment of **Casting Time**.

### Rank
This is the minimum rank at which a spell must be cast.  This is used in place of “level” to avoid confusion with character/monster level.

### Range
Spells use the same values as are used for ranged weapons:<br/>
**(C)lose** - (5ft)<br/>
**(N)ear** - (30ft)<br/>
**(F)ar** - (150ft)<br/>
**(S)ight** - Within Line of Sight (LoS)<br/>
**(D)istant** - Beyond perception

Two additional ranges are also added:<br/>
**(T)ouch** – magical arts with a range of touch require the caster to physically touch the subject.  Unwilling targets require an **Attack Roll** vs the target's **AC**.<br/>
**(P)ersonal** – This spell will only affect the caster.

Unless otherwise noted, any spell with a range of **Near**, **Far**, **Sight** or **Distant**, that requires an **Attack Roll**, will suffer **Disadvantage** on that Attack Roll if cast within **Close** range of an enemy.

Unless otherwise noted, any spell cast at a range of **Far** or greater, that requires an **Attack Roll** will suffer **Disadvantage** on that attack roll.

### Area
This is the area over which the magical art’s effects can be felt:<br/>
**Self** – Affects the caster only.<br/>
**Creature/Object** – Affects the targeted creature(s) or object(s) only.<br/>
**Tiny** – Affects an area no larger than 6 cubic inches.<br/>
**Small** – Affects an area no larger than 3 cubic feet.<br/>
**Medium** – Affects an area no larger than 5 cubic feet.<br/>
**Large** – Affects an area up to 10 cubic feet.<br/>
**Huge** – Affects an area up to 20 cubic feet.<br/>
**Gargantuan** – Affects an area up to 40 cubic feet.<br/>
**Other** – Has a different area of effect outlined in the magical art’s description.<br/>

### Duration
This indicates how long a spell will continue to affect the target(s).  Additionally, spells whose duration is marked with a (c) indicate that [Concentration](TheMagicalArts.md#Concentration) is required to maintain the magic.

### Save
This indicates if a target is allowed to make a [Saving Throw](Core_Rules#Saving-Throws) to resist or diminish the effect.  This will be given as a saving throw type.

## Upcasting
Several spells allow the caster to increase the **rank** at which the spell is cast in return for enhanced effects.  Doing so increases the **Spellcasting DT** of the spell to match the new rank.  No spell may be cast at a rank higher than that to which the spellcaster has access.  *For example, a 5th level spellcaster may not cast any spells at a rank higher than 3.*
