# Spells
Spells are the magical formula by which the power of the sigils may be harnessed and directed.

Within this section you will find a list of spells for use in the *Cavern Crawlers* game.  This list is by no means definitive and the GM and players should work together if they wish to bring spells from other sources into the game.

## Spell Descriptions

All spell descriptions contain the following information.

### Tier
This is the spell's Tier, which determines who may learn the spell.

### Sigils
Which [sigils](Sigils.md) are required for the casting of the spell.

### Casting Ability
This identifies which **Ability Score Modifier** (Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma) is used to compute the **Saving Throw DT** or **Attack Modifier** of any spells you cast.

### Casting Time
This is the minimum amount of time it takes to successfully cast a spell.  If a spell takes multiple rolls to cast, each roll is made at the end of each increment of **Casting Time**.

### Range
Spells use the same values as are used for ranged weapons:<br/>
**(C)lose** - (5ft)<br/>
**(N)ear** - (30ft)<br/>
**(F)ar** - (150ft)<br/>
**(S)ight** - Within Line of Sight (LoS)<br/>
**(D)istant** - Beyond perception

Two additional ranges are also added:<br/>
**(T)ouch** – magical arts with a range of touch require the caster to physically touch the subject.  Unwilling targets require an **Attack Roll** vs the target's **AC**.<br/>
**(P)ersonal** – This spell will only affect the caster.

Unless otherwise noted, any spell with a range of **Near**, **Far**, **Sight** or **Distant**, that requires an **Attack Roll**, will suffer **Disadvantage** on that Attack Roll if cast within **Close** range of an enemy.

Unless otherwise noted, any spell cast at a range of **Far** or greater, that requires an **Attack Roll** will suffer **Disadvantage** on that attack roll.

### Area
This is the area over which the magical art’s effects can be felt:<br/>
**(Se)lf** – Affects the caster only.<br/>
**(Cr)eature/(Ob)ject** – Affects the targeted creature(s) or object(s) only.<br/>
**(T)iny** – Affects an area no larger than 216 cubic inches (a 6x6x6 inch cube).<br/>
**(Sm)all** – Affects an area no larger than 27 cubic feet (3x3x3 feet).<br/>
**(M)edium** – Affects an area no larger than 125 cubic feet (5x5x5 feet).<br/>
**(L)arge** – Affects an area up to 1,000 cubic feet (10x10x10 feet).<br/>
**(H)uge** – Affects an area up to 8,000 cubic feet (20x20x20).<br/>
**(G)argantuan** – Affects an area up to 6,400 cubic feet (40x40x40).<br/>
**Other** – Has a different area of effect outlined in the magical art’s description.<br/>

### Duration
This indicates how long a spell will continue to affect the target(s).  Additionally, spells whose duration is marked with a (c) indicate that [Concentration](MagicalArts.md#Concentration) is required to maintain the magic.
- 1 (Re)action
- 1 (A)ction
- 1 (Ro)und
- 1 (Mi)nute
- 1 Exploration (T)urn (10 minutes)
- 1 (H)our
- 1 (W)atch (4 hours)
- 1 (D)ay
- 1 (W)eek
- 1 (Mo)nth
- 1 (Y)ear
- double the number of years for each additional step.

### Save
This indicates if a target is allowed to make a [Saving Throw](CoreRules.md#Saving%20Throws) to resist or diminish the effect.  This will be given as a saving throw type.

### Components
Spells will often require **Gestures**, **Incantations** or both to cast.  If any one element is missing or restricted, the spell cannot be cast and any [Invocation Roll](MagicalArts.md#the%20invocation%20roll) will automatically fail.
- **Gestures** require at least one free hand (though it may be holding your Magical Focus or Sigil).
- **Incantations** require the caster be able to speak freely and not be in a zone of total silence.

## Upcasting
Several spells allow the caster to increase the difficulty in casting the spell in return for enhanced effects.  

## Example Spells

### Mend
- **Tier:** 0 (cantrip)
- **Sigils** A form or elemental sigil matching the target type.
- **Casting Ability:** Wisdom
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Area:** 1 Creature or a Tiny area
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Save:** none
- **Components:** Gestures & Incantations

By means of this spell, the mage uses the power of a sigil to heal or mend a given object.  The sigil selected when casting this spell must match the target type (Person for healing a sapient being, Beast to heal an animal, Earth to mend a stone wall, etc).

If used to heal a living being, this spell will heal 1 HP.

If used on an inanimate object, 1 Tiny area of material will be made whole.  This area may be increased by 1 category per +1 rank.  Thus, to mend a cut hemp rope, the mage would apply the Plant sigil at rank zero.  To mend a 10 x 10 x 5 foot section of castle wall (500 cubic feet) would require casting the spell at Rank 3 (for a Large area of effect).

*Upcasting*

| Tier    | Range | Area            | Other      |
|:-------:|:-----:|:---------------:|:-----------|
| 1 (3+)  | C     | 2 Cr or S       | Heal 2 HP  |
| 2 (6+)  | N     | 3 Cr or M       | Heal 3 HP  |
| 3 (9+)  | N     | 4 Cr or L       | Heal 4 HP  |
| +1 (+3) | --    | +2 Cr or 1 Step | Heal +1 HP |

## Spark
- **Tier:** Cantrip (0+)
- **Sigils** any elemental sigil
- **Casting Ability:** Intelligence
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Near
- **Area:** 1 Creature/Object
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Save:** none
- **Components:** Gestures & Incantations

By means of this spell, the caster uses the power of a sigil to conjure a small amount of a single element (approximately 1 cubic inch).  At it's minimum, this spell does negligible damage, but can produce utilitarian effects (such as using the Fire sigil to ignite a torch).  Alternatively, the mage may use this as an attack (requiring a [Magical Attack](MagicalArts.md#Magical%20Attacks%20and%20Saving%20Throws) vs an unwilling target), doing 1d4 damage of the selected type.

*Upcasting*

| Tier    | Range | Area     | Damage |
|:-------:|:-----:|:--------:|:------:|
| 1 (3+)  | N     | 2 Cr/Ob  | 1d4    |
| 2 (6+)  | N     | 3 Cr/Ob  | 1d6    |
| 3 (9+)  | F     | 4 Cr/Ob  | 1d6    |
| 4 (12+) | F     | 5 Cr/Ob  | 1d8    |
| +1 (+3) | --    | +1 Cr/Ob | --     |
