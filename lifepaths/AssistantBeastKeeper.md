The old witch in the village took a liking to you when you were still young, and you now keep her animals for her. While what you do may seem inconsequential, the witch seems to consider you to be vitally important, and favors you above all others. You dream of a more exciting life.  

You have a knack with animals. Your Constitution and Wisdom begin at 10, and all of your other ability scores begin at 8.

You gain access to the [Animal Handler](optional/Background.md#animal%20handler) background.
