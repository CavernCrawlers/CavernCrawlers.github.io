# The Gifted Dilettante
## (Rogue-Spellcaster)
You are not the eldest in your family. You are not the greatest warrior of your many siblings, or a diligent student of the arcane arts. Rather, you have a broad range of abilities, a sharp mind, and a winning smile. You’ve also dabbled in some things you probably shouldn’t have. You know a bit of everything, and are rather bored with your situation. You gain access to the [Politician](Background.md#politician) background.

## Childhood
You are intelligent and charming. Your Intelligence and Charisma begin at 10, and all of your other ability scores begin at 8.
