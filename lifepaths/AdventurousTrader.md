## Fill out your sheet.
1. Record your name, background, class and level.
2. Record your ability scores. If any ability score ends up over 18, reduce it to 18 and place the excess points wherever you wish, so long as no ability ends up over 18. In the space beside each, record your [ability score modifier](CharacterCreation.md#attribute-modifiers).
3. Jot down your class abilities, knack, trait and starting equipment, as well as any other pieces of gear you may want to buy.<br/>The Adventurous Trader begins with the following equipment: a dagger, a backpack, practical clothes, a heavy cloak, a bedroll, a mess kit, a tinderbox, 10 torches, 1 week’s rations, 50ft rope, leather armor, one light weapon, one medium weapon, nice clothes, your helper (counts as an ally), a cart and mule and 200 silvers worth of goods (according to you, at least), and 10+2d6sp
4. Pick your starting languages. If your INT Bonus is -1 or less, you start with only 1 language (typically your native language).

Finally, your character is illiterate unless you spend a language choice on literacy or are a spellcaster.
5. Your Base Attack Bonus comes from your class. As a level 1 rogue, you have a BAB of +1.
6. Your Skill bonus comes from your class.  As a level 1 Rogue, you have a SB of +1.
7. Your Initiative Bonus is equal your Dexterity bonus plus 2 for being a Rogue.
8. Your Armor Class is 10, plus your Dexterity bonus, plus the bonus of any [armor](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#armor) you have.
