# The Dabbling Diabolist
## (Spellcaster)
Your innate curiosity got the better of you, and you ended up invoking magical forces you weren’t powerful enough to master. Something or someone came through from the world of Demons, and now it’s with you always, plotting, scheming, and promising mystical might.

## Childhood
It takes a formidable ego and sense of self to truck with dark forces, accidentally or otherwise. Your Charisma begins at 12, and all of your other ability scores begin at 8.

### What was your childhood like?

You would later learn that this accident released powerful magic. Unfortunately, you were not yet capable of sufficiently harnessing or channeling this energy, and unexpected consequences resulted.

|  6 | **Hexed:** The player whose name comes last alphabetically chooses a named villager. This person is plagued with bad luck and misfortune. |

You gain the class abilities _Exhausting Magic_, _Invocation Dice_, _Magical Focus_, _Spellcasting_ and _Sense Magic_.  You also learn the [Hexing](TierZeroSpells.md#hexing) cantrip and Person [rune](Runes.md). The tables below will tell you your other traits and spells.

## Generating Your Familiar
You are the only one who knows your familiar’s true form (your GM will determine it’s true appearance).  In being bound to you, it has permanently taken on the animal form it now uses.  However, those with certain magical senses (such as the Spirit Sight spell) can see it’s true form as a ghostly overlay of its animal form.
Step 1: d12 Result – The familiar’s Special Defense.
Steps 2: 2d8 Result – As a Minor Demon, your familiar has 2 HD. The sum of this roll determines the Hit Points of your familiar.  For every level you gain past 2nd, your familiar gains 1 HD, up to a maximum of 10.
Step 3: d12 Result: Sphere of Influence – Your familiar gains its power from/feeds on this. Your familiar is too minor and demoted to gain a Power.
Step 4: d12 Result: Sphere of Influence – Your familiar uses this to gather/acquire power. Your familiar is too minor and demoted to gain a Power.
Step 5: d6 Result: Demon’s Weakness – Use the results of this roll to generate your familiar’s Weakness.
Step 6: d30 Result: The demon's true form.
Step 7: d8 Result: The demon's basic attack.
Step 8: d12 Result: The demon's special attack.

## Fill out your sheet.
1. Record your name, background, class and level.
2. Record your ability scores. If any ability score ends up over 18, reduce it to 18 and place the excess points wherever you wish, so long as no ability ends up over 18. In the space beside each, record your [ability score modifier](CharacterCreation.md#attribute-modifiers).
3. Jot down your class abilities, trait and starting equipment, as well as any other pieces of gear you may want to buy.<br/>The Dabbling Diabolist begins with the following equipment: your background trappings, a backpack, an athame (dagger and magical focus), a book of occult lore, common robes, spellbook, many pouches, a light weapon and 4d6+10sp
4. Pick your starting languages. If your INT Bonus is -1 or less, you start with only 1 language (typically your native language). If it is +0 or higher, you start with 2 languages plus additional languages equal to your INT bonus. Usually one of these will be a common trade language. Finally, your character is literate because they are a spellcaster.
5. Write down your starting [cantrips](TierZeroSpells.md).
6. Write down your starting [spells](TierONeSpells.md).
7. Write down your starting [runes](Runes.md).  If you rolled the same rune multiple times, you may replace the duplicate(s) with different runes of the same type.
8. Your Base Attack Bonus comes from your class. As a level 1 Spellcaster, you have a BAB of +0.
9. Your Skill bonus comes from your class.  As a level 1 Spellcaster, you have a SB of +1.
10. Your Initiative Bonus is equal your Dexterity bonus plus 0 for being a Spellcaster.
11. Your Armor Class is 10, plus your Dexterity bonus, plus the bonus of any [armor](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#armor) you have.
12. Your Base and Max Fortune Points are both 2.
13. Your starting Hit Points equal to 4 plus your Constitution Modifier.
14. Fill in your [Saving Throws](Spellcaster.md#spellcaster-saving-throws) using the chart in the Spellcaster document.
15. Record the ‘to hit’ and ‘damage’ statistics for any [weapons](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#weapons) you think you might use. Your to hit bonus for a normal melee weapon is your BAB plus your Strength bonus and for a normal missile weapon is your BAB plus your Dexterity bonus. For Finesse and Thrown weapons, you add your BAB and the higher of your Strength or Dexterity bonuses.
