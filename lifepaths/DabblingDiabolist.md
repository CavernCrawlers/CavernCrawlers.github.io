# The Dabbling Diabolist
## (Spellcaster)
Your innate curiosity got the better of you, and you ended up invoking magical forces you weren’t powerful enough to master. Something or someone came through from the world of Demons, and now it’s with you always, plotting, scheming, and promising mystical might.  You gain access to the [Cult Initiate](Background.md#cult%20initiate) background.

## Childhood
It takes a formidable ego and sense of self to truck with dark forces, accidentally or otherwise. Your Charisma begins at 12, and all of your other ability scores begin at 8.

### What was your childhood like?

You would later learn that this accident released powerful magic. Unfortunately, you were not yet capable of sufficiently harnessing this energy, and unexpected consequences resulted.

| d6 | What happened and which of the other PC's helped you figure out what went wrong? |
|:--:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1 | **Magic Circle:** The *oldest* player chooses a location on the Village Map. An indelible circle surrounds that location, scored deeply in the land. Some nights it glows malevolently. |
|  2 | **Mystical Mists:** The *youngest* player chooses a Month of the Year. During this month, the entire Village is surrounded in fog as thick as pea soup. |
|  3 | **Unseen Spirit:** The *tallest* player picks a location on the Village Map. To this day, strange goings on plague this location (lights go out, doors slam, furniture re-arranges itself) on nights with a New Moon. |
|  4 | **Arcane Mark:** The *shortest* player chooses a day of the month. Anyone born in the village on this day of any month bears a mysterious birthmark. |
|  5 | **Sorcerous Storm:** The player whose name comes *first* alphabetically chooses a Season. The weather during this season is extreme and unpredictable. |
|  6 | **Hexed:** The player whose name comes last alphabetically chooses a named villager. This person is plagued with bad luck and misfortune. |

### How has the threat of {threat} affected your childhood?
Pick one of the campaign threats and roll on the related Character History Table.

## Apprenticeship
Your magical accident attracted the attention of an otherworldly spirit.  This spirit has come to you to teach you the ways of magic. You become a level 1 [Spellcaster](classes/Spellcaster.md). You gain the class abilities _Magical Focus_, _Spellcasting_ and _Sense Magic_.  You also learn the [Hexing](TierZeroSpells.md#hexing) cantrip and Humanoid [sigil](Sigils.md). The tables below will tell you your other traits and spells.

## Generating Your Familiar
You are the only one who knows your familiar’s true form (your GM will determine it’s true appearance).  In being bound to you, it has permanently taken on the animal form it now uses.  However, those with certain magical senses (such as the Spirit Sight spell) can see it’s true form as a ghostly overlay of its animal form.
Step 1: d12 Result – The familiar’s Special Defense.
Steps 2: 2d6 Result – As a Minor Demon, your familiar has 2d6 HD. The sum of this roll determines the Hit Points of your familiar.  For every level you gain past 2nd, your familiar gains 1 HD, up to a maximum of 10.
Step 3: d12 Result: Sphere of Influence – Your familiar gains its power from this. Your familiar is too minor and demoted to gain a Power.
Step 4: d6 Result: Demon’s Weakness – Use the results of this roll to generate your familiar’s Weakness.
Step 5: d30 Result: The demon's true form.
Step 6: d8 Result: The demon's basic attack.
Step 7: d12 Result: The demon's special attack.

For Finesse and Thrown weapons, you add your BAB and the higher of your Strength or Dexterity bonuses.
