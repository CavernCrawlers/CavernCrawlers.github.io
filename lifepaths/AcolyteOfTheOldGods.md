# The Acolyte of the Old Gods
## (Spellcaster)
While your childhood was that of an ordinary villager, something miraculous happened when you came of age. After a dramatic event, you felt the call of the old gods, and now worship them openly, as your ancestors did. One of these ancient deities shows you particular favor, and you now do their work amongst your people.  You gain the [Acolyte](Background.md#acolyte) background.

## Childhood
You are wise beyond your years. Your Wisdom begins at 12, and all of your other ability scores begin at 8.

### What was your childhood like?

## Fill out your sheet.
1. Record your name, background, class and level.
2. Record your ability scores. If any ability score ends up over 18, reduce it to 18 and place the excess points wherever you wish, so long as no ability ends up over 18. In the space beside each, record your [ability score modifier](CharacterCreation.md#attribute-modifiers).
3. Jot down your class abilities, trait and starting equipment, as well as any other pieces of gear you may want to buy.<br/>The Acolyte of the Old Gods begins with the following equipment: a dagger, a backpack, practical clothes, a prayer/spell book, a holy symbol (your magical focus), a stout walking staff (quarterstaff) and 4d6+10sp
4. Pick your starting languages. If your INT Bonus is -1 or less, you start with only 1 language (typically your native language). If it is +0 or higher, you start with 2 languages plus additional languages equal to your INT bonus. Usually one of these will be a common trade language. Finally, your character is literate because they are a spellcaster.
5. Write down your starting [cantrips](TierZeroSpells.md) and [spells](TierONeSpells.md).
6. Write down your starting [runes](Runes.md).  If you rolled the same rune multiple times, you may replace the duplicate(s) with different runes of the same type.
5. Your Base Attack Bonus comes from your class. As a level 1 Spellcaster, you have a BAB of +0.
6. Your Skill bonus comes from your class.  As a level 1 Spellcaster, you have a SB of +1.
7. Your Initiative Bonus is equal your Dexterity bonus plus 0 for being a Spellcaster.
8. Your Armor Class is 10, plus your Dexterity bonus, plus the bonus of any [armor](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#armor) you have.
9. Your Base and Max Fortune Points are both 2.
10. Your starting Hit Points equal to 4 plus your Constitution Modifier.
11. Fill in your [Saving Throws](Spellcaster.md#spellcaster-saving-throws) using the chart in the Spellcaster document.
12. Record the ‘to hit’ and ‘damage’ statistics for any [weapons](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#weapons) you think you might use. Your to hit bonus for a normal melee weapon is your BAB plus your Strength bonus and for a normal missile weapon is your BAB plus your Dexterity bonus. For Finesse and Thrown weapons, you add your BAB and the higher of your Strength or Dexterity bonuses.
