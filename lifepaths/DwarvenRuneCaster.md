# The Dwarven Rune Caster
## (Fighter-Spellcaster)
Even more than others of your kin, you grew up valuing the past and keeping the stories and chants of your people. At a young age, you were apprenticed to the rune master and learned the secret magic of the dwarves.  You gain the [Scholar/Sage](Background.md#scholar-sage) background.

## Childhood
You are tough, and hold much lore in your head, but sometimes have little time for fools. Your Constitution, Intelligence, and Wisdom begin at 10, your Charisma begins at 6, and all of your other ability scores begin at 8.


### What was your childhood like?

2. Record your species and the [features](Dwarf.md#features) that come from it.
3. Record your ability scores. If any ability score ends up over 18, reduce it to 18 and place the excess points wherever you wish, so long as no ability ends up over 18. In the space beside each, record your [ability score modifier](CharacterCreation.md#attribute-modifiers).
4. Jot down your class abilities, knack, trait and starting equipment (as well as any other pieces of gear you may want to buy).<br/>The Dwarven Rune Caster begins with the following equipment: a dagger, a quill, ink, 10 sheets of parchment, a book of lore (pick one subject), a backpack, common clothing, a tinderbox, tools for arms and armor maintenance, a light weapon and scale mail, either 2 weapons or a weapon and shield, and 4d6+5sp.  You also have the equipment rolled in the tables above.
5. Write down your starting [cantrips](TierZeroSpells.md).
6. Write down your starting [runes](Runes.md).  If you rolled the same rune multiple times, you may replace the duplicate(s) with different runes of the same type.
7. Pick your starting languages. If your INT Bonus is -1 or less, you start with only 1 language (typically your native language). If it is +0 or higher, you start with 2 languages plus additional languages equal to your INT bonus. Usually one of these will be a common trade language. Finally, your character is literate because they are a spellcaster.

9. Your Skill bonus comes from your class.  As a level 1 Fighter-Spellcaster, you have a SB of +1.
10. Your Initiative Bonus is equal your Dexterity bonus plus 0 for being a fighter-spellcaster.
11. Your Armor Class is 10, plus your Dexterity bonus, plus the bonus of any [armor](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#armor) you have.
12. As a Dwarven fighter-spellcaster, your Base and Max Fortune Points are both 1.
13. Your starting Hit Points equal to 6 plus your Constitution Modifier plus 1 for being a Dwarf.
14. Fill in your [Saving Throws](fighter-Spellcaster.md#fighter-spellcaster-saving-throws) using the chart in the Fighter-Spellcaster document.  Remember to add +2 to your Hardiness save for being a dwarf.
