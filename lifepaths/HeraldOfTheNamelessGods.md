# Herald of the Nameless Gods
## (Spellcaster)
Perhaps you were born under stars of ill-omen, or a moon of sinister aspect or maybe there were no portents at all.  Regardless, for as long as you remember, you’ve heard the whispers.  Most chalked it up to imaginary friends conjured by an over-active imagination.  You, however, have begun to discern the truth.  The Voice has become clearer since coming of age and it tells you of the things lurking beyond the outer darkness.  Most speak of these inscrutable entities as the “nameless gods”, but you know they have names.  You seek to learn those names and their nature.  Then, armed with such knowledge, you will choose whether to welcome them back into the world of mortals, or turn your gifts to shoring up the barriers that keep them at bay.  You may choose the [Cult Initiate](Background.md#cult%20initiate) background.

## Childhood
The Voice has told you many secrets, including how to best get what you want from others.  Your Intelligence and Charisma begin at 10, and all your other ability scores begin at 8.

### What was your childhood like?

When you came of age, the Voice became clearer and began instructing you in the ways of magic. You become a level 1 [Spellcaster](Spellcaster.md). You gain the class abilities _Exhausting Magic_, _Invocation Dice_, _Magical Focus_, _Spellcasting_ and _Sense Magic_.  You also learn the [Beguilement](TierZeroSpells.md#beguilement) cantrip and Person [sigil](sigils.md). The tables below will tell you your other traits and spells.
