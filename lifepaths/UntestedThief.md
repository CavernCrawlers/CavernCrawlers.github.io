The world is full of things to see and enjoy, and your fingers are more than quick enough to let you have what you like.  You gain access to the [Criminal](optional/Background.md#criminal) background.

## Childhood
You are deft and quick. Your Dexterity begins at 12, and all of your other ability scores begin at 8.

### What was your childhood like?

You gain the class abilities _Fortune’s Favor_, _[Rogue](classes/Rogue.md) Skills,_ and _Sneak Attack_. The tables below will give you all your [Knacks](classes/Rogue.md#rogue%20knacks) and [Traits](Traits.md).
