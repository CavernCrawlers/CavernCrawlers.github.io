# The Elven Ranger
## (Rogue-Spellcaster)
You are a remnant of one of the hidden communities of wood elves. The forests are your home, and you wander freely within them, watching communities of humans, tracking destructive raiders, and protecting the wild places of the world. Now you live near a human town and have taken a liking to several of the locals.

## Childhood
You are adept at remaining hidden and finding your way in the wilderness.  Your Dexterity and Wisdom begin at 10, and all your other ability scores begin at 8.

### How did you come to the lands of humans?
