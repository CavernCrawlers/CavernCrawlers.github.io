# The Elven Ranger
## (Rogue-Spellcaster)
You are a remnant of one of the hidden communities of wood elves. The forests are your home, and you wander freely within them, watching communities of humans, tracking destructive raiders, and protecting the wild places of the world. Now you live near a human town and have taken a liking to several of the locals.

## Childhood
You are adept at remaining hidden and finding your way in the wilderness.  Your Dexterity and Wisdom begin at 10, and all your other ability scores begin at 8.

### How did you come to the lands of humans?

## Fill out your sheet.
1. Record your name, background, class and level.
2. Record your species and the [features](Elf.md#features) that come from it.
3. Record your ability scores. If any ability score ends up over 18, reduce it to 18 and place the excess points wherever you wish, so long as no ability ends up over 18. In the space beside each, record your [ability score modifier](CharacterCreation.md#attribute-modifiers).
4. Jot down your class abilities, knack, trait and starting equipment (as well as any other pieces of gear you may want to buy).<br/>The Elven Ranger begins with the following equipment: your background trappings, a magical focus, a backpack, elven clothes, a elvish travelling cloak, a bedroll, a mess kit, a tinderbox, 10 torches, 1 week’s rations, 50ft silken rope, leather armor, one light weapon, one medium weapon, 4d6sp plus whatever equipment you rolled above.
5. Write down your starting [cantrips](TierZeroSpells.md).
6. Write down your starting [runes](Runes.md).  If you rolled the same rune multiple times, you may replace the duplicate(s) with different runes of the same type.
7. Pick your starting languages. If your INT Bonus is -1 or less, you start with only 1 language (typically your native language). If it is +0 or higher, you start with 2 languages plus additional languages equal to your INT bonus. Usually one of these will be a common trade language. Finally, your character is literate because they are a spellcaster.

10. Your Initiative Bonus is equal your Dexterity bonus plus 1 for being a Rogue-Spellcaster.
11. Your Armor Class is 10, plus your Dexterity bonus, plus the bonus of any [armor](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#armor) you have.
12. As an Elven Rogue-Spellcaster, your Base and Max Fortune Points are both 1.
13. Your starting Hit Points equal to 5 plus your Constitution Modifier.
14. Fill in your [Saving Throws](Rogue-Spellcaster.md#rogue-spellcaster-saving-throws) using the chart in the Rogue-Spellcaster document.
