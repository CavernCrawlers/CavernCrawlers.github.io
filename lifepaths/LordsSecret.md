## Childhood
Years ago, the local {lord/lady} returned from an adventure, quest, or war party. Only an infant, you were with {him/her}, a strange child of uncertain heritage. Raised in the noble house but always apart, you made close friends with the witch and a few others, but have always been an outsider in the eyes of the others in the castle.

You are hardy and quick-witted. Your Constitution and Intelligence begin at 10, and all of your other ability scores begin at 8.
