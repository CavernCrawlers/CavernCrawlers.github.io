# Goblin Rat Tamer
## (Fighter-Rogue)
You raised and trained the giant rats your clan used the same way other cultures use hounds.  You gain access to the [Animal Handler](Background.md#animal%20handler) background.

## Childhood
Rat-taming requires a quick hand, an empathetic attitude and a tolerance for getting bit.  Your Dexterity, Constitution and Charisma start at 10.  Your Strength starts at 6.  All your other ability scores begin at 8.

### How did you come to be in the lands of the humans?
![](Birthright.md#goblin)

![](LeavingHomeland.md#tribal)

![](VillageFriend.md#goblin)

### How has the threat of {threat} affected your childhood?
Pick one of the campaign threats and roll on the related Character History Table.

## Apprenticeship
You spent much time in the rat pens, which is fine.  You liked your rats more than you liked most people. You become a level 1 [Fighter-Rogue](classes/Fighter-Rogue.md). You gain the class abilities *Fortune's Favor* and *Rogue Skills*.  The tables below will tell you your other abilities.
