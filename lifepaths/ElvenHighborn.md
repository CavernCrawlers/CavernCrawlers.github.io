# The Elven Highborn
## (Fighter-Spellcaster)
Your people are scarce now, most having gone far away from the troubled lands of humans. Your family stayed, however, your mother acting as the leader of a small elven enclave which remained, secluded from humans. You have left that enclave now, and must find your way among strange people.  You gain the [Noble](Background.md#noble) background.

## Childhood
You are quick and intelligent. Your Dexterity and Intelligence begin at 10, and all of your other ability scores begin at 8.


### How did you come to the lands of humans?

If it is +0 or higher, you start with 2 languages plus additional languages equal to your INT bonus. Usually one of these will be a common trade language.
