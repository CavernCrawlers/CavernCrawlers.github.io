# The Elven Highborn
## ([Fighter-Spellcaster](classes/Fighter-Spellcaster.md))
Your people are scarce now, most having gone far away from the troubled lands of humans. Your family stayed, however, your mother acting as the leader of a small elven enclave which remained, secluded from humans. You have left that enclave now, and must find your way among strange people.  You gain access to the [Noble](Background.md#noble) background.

## Childhood
You are quick and intelligent. Your Dexterity and Intelligence begin at 10, and all of your other ability scores begin at 8.

### How did you come to the lands of humans?

You gain the class abilities *Exhausting Magic*, *Spellcasting*, *Sense Magic*, the cantrip [Glamour](magic/TierZeroSpells.md#glamour) and the Illusion [sigil](magic/Sigils.md).
