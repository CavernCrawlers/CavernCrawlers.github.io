# The Neophyte Druid
## (Spellcaster)
The wilderness is a wild, untamed place. Though you grew up in the marginally civilized confines of the village, you demonstrated a gift that set you apart from the other children. You were selected to be taught the Old Ways of Nature, a force that was ancient when the eldest gods were conceived.  You may choose the [Forester](Background.md#forester) background.

## Childhood
You are naturally philosophical and possess an animal cunning. Your Wisdom and Intelligence begin at 10, all other attributes are 8.

### What was your childhood like?

Pick one of the campaign threats and roll on the related Character History Table.

## Apprenticeship
In the middle of the night, a solemn procession of robed figures bearing firebrands strode to through the streets of the village toward your home. Their ancient authority was not to be argued with and they spirited you away into the wilderness. You become a level 1 [Spellcaster](Spellcaster.md). You gain the class abilities _Exhausting Magic_, _Invocation Dice_, _Magical Focus_, _Spellcasting_ and _Sense Magic_.  You also learn the [Nature's Blessing](TierZeroSpells.md#nature's%20blessing) cantrip and Plant [sigil](sigils.md). The tables below will tell you your other traits and spells.
