## Childhood
You are strong and hardy, but sometimes have difficulty holding your tongue. Your Strength begins at 10, your Constitution begins at 12, your Charisma begins at 6, and all of your other ability scores begin at 8.

You also have the equipment rolled in the tables above.
6. Pick your starting languages. If your INT Bonus is -1 or less, you start with only 1 language (typically your native language). If it is +0 or higher, you start with 2 languages plus additional languages equal to your INT bonus. Usually one of these will be a common trade language. Finally, your character is illiterate unless you spend a language choice on literacy or are a spellcaster.
