# The Dwarven Adventurer
## (Fighter)
The lands of your own people in the hills and mountains are no longer a home for you. You have journeyed to the lands of humans to find your fortune and make your own way. Somehow, you have made strange friends in places where you expected to find only foes. And more importantly you found treasure.

## Childhood
You are strong and hardy, but sometimes have difficulty holding your tongue. Your Strength begins at 10, your Constitution begins at 12, your Charisma begins at 6, and all of your other ability scores begin at 8.

### What was your childhood like?

## Fill out your sheet.
1. Record your name, background, class and level.
2. Record your species and the [features](Dwarf.md#features) that come from it.
3. Record your ability scores. If any ability score ends up over 18, reduce it to 18 and place the excess points wherever you wish, so long as no ability ends up over 18. In the space beside each, record your [ability score modifier](CharacterCreation.md#attribute-modifiers).
4. Jot down your class abilities, knack, trait and starting equipment, as well as any other pieces of gear you may want to buy.<br/>The Dwarven Adventurer begins with the following equipment: your background trappings, a backpack, common dwarven garb, a tinderbox, tools for arms and armor maintenance, scalemail, 1 light weapon, either 2 medium weapons or a medium weapon and shield, and 4d6sp.  You also have the equipment rolled in the tables above.
5. Pick your starting languages. If your INT Bonus is -1 or less, you start with only 1 language (typically your native language). If it is +0 or higher, you start with 2 languages plus additional languages equal to your INT bonus. Usually one of these will be a common trade language. Finally, your character is illiterate unless you spend a language choice on literacy or are a spellcaster.
6. Your Base Attack Bonus comes from your class. As a level 1 Fighter, you have a BAB of +1.
7. Your Skill bonus comes from your class.  As a level 1 Fighter, you have a SB of +1.
8. Your Initiative Bonus is equal your Dexterity bonus plus 1 for being a Fighter.
9. Your Armor Class is 10, plus your Dexterity bonus, plus the bonus of any [armor](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#armor) you have.
10. As a Dwarf, your Base and Max Fortune Points are both 1.
11. Your starting Hit Points equal to 8 plus your Constitution Modifier plus 1 for being a Dwarf.
12. Fill in your [Saving Throws](Fighter.md#fighter-saving-throws) using the chart in the Fighter document.  Remember to add +2 to your Hardiness save for being a dwarf.
13. Record the ‘to hit’ and ‘damage’ statistics for any [weapons](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#weapons) you think you might use. Your to hit bonus for a normal melee weapon is your BAB plus your Strength bonus and for a normal missile weapon is your BAB plus your Dexterity bonus. For Finesse and Thrown weapons, you add your BAB and the higher of your Strength or Dexterity bonuses.
