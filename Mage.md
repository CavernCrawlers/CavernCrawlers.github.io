## Class Abilities
### Exhausting Magic
If you fail an **Invocation** check, you may increase the check total by +3 per level of **Exhaustion** gained.

### Magical Focus
As part of your apprenticeship, you created a unique magical focus to aid in your spellcasting.  This focus may take most any form (a staff, wand, amulet or similar), but must be easily seen, recognized and hand-held.  If you attempt to cast a spell without your focus in hand, you do so with **Disadvantage** on the **Invocation** roll.  A focus may be replaced by constructing a new one which takes 1 week in a **Safe Haven** and 50sp worth of materials.

### Magic User
You can harness the power of magic with **Cantrips**, **Spells** and **Rituals** (collectively called **Magical Arts**).  A mage begins their career knowing two cantrips, two spells and a single ritual.  You will need to select a **Magical Tradition** from which your magical arts will be drawn.

### Sense Magic
Being sensitive to the world of magic, you may determine if a person, place or thing is magical with a **Perception** check.  Doing so requires concentration and a few minutes; so you cannot tell if something is magical simply by being in its presence and people tend to notice when a mage is staring at them.  You can also attempt to decipher magical writing with an **Intelligence** check.

### True Name
As a magic-user possessing supernatural power, you have a **True Name**.  Those who know your True Name can use it against you.  By calling out your True Name, a creature gains **Advantage** on all actions taken against you, including attacks and you have **Disadvantage** on your **Invocation** checks to cast spells against them.
