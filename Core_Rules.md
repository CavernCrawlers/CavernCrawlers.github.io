# Core Rules
The earlier [Rules Synopsis](RulesSynopsis.md) provided a quick overview of the base game mechanics. In this chapter we'll go into more details about the rules and procedures for implementing them in your games.

## The D20 Check
The core mechanic of this system is the **D20 Check**.  There are three broad types of D20 check: the **Ability Check**, the **Skilled Check** and the **Attack Roll**.  An Ability Check is the roll of a 20-sided die, modified by the character's relevant **Ability Modifier** and then compared to a target difficulty.  Skilled Checks and Attack Rolls can be consider sub-types of the Ability Check, which add in a character's **Skill Modifier** or **Attack Bonus** (respectively).
