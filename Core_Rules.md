# Core Rules
The earlier [Rules Synopsis](RulesSynopsis.md) provided a quick overview of the base game mechanics. In this chapter we'll go into more details about the rules and procedures for implementing them in your games.

## The D20 Check
The core mechanic of this system is the **D20 Check**.  There are three broad types of D20 check: the **Ability Check**, the **Skilled Check** and the **Attack Roll**.  An Ability Check is the roll of a 20-sided die, modified by the character's relevant **Ability Modifier** and then compared to a target difficulty.  Skilled Checks and Attack Rolls can be consider sub-types of the Ability Check, which add in a character's **Skill Modifier** or **Attack Bonus** (respectively).

### When to Roll
Add D20 Check should only be called for when there is both doubt as to the action's success and consequences for failure.  If the outcome is a given (either success or failure), there is no need to roll.  Likewise, if there is no consequence for failure the actor can take as much time as they need to succeed, so success should simply be assumed unless the action is impossible.

### Modifiers
Situational arithmetic modifiers should generally be applied to the target DT rather than the die roll itself.  Typically these will range from +5 (for an exceptionally difficult task) to -5 (for an exceptionally easy task) with +3 to -3 being much more common.

### Flavor Bonus
Providing a rich and exciting description of how your character accomplishes an action is worth a small  (+1 or +2) bonus on the D20 check.  Note, however, this should be a unique description; simply repeating the same description over and over is not worth a bonus.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
In cases where multiple factors combine to make a task generally easier or harder but no hard and fast numeric modifier exists, the roll should be made either with **Advantage** or **Disadvantage**. Otherwise see the earlier primer on [Advantage and Disadvantage](RulesSynopsis.md#Advantage-and-Disadvantage) for additional details.

### Contested Checks
When two individuals are working against one another, a **Contested Check** is called for.  Each party performs a **D20 Check** as described above.  Whomever has the highest total is the winner of the contest.  In the event of a tie, **Advantage** beats Normal beats **Disadvantage**.  If still tied, whomever has the highest total bonus to their roll wins.  If still tied, re-roll if a tie result does not make sense for the situation.

Some contests require multiple checks to resolve.  For example, a long foot race may require 3 total checks to complete.  In this case, whomever achieves the most victories is considered the overall winner.

### Passive Checks
In cases where a **passive check** is called for, the check is made with an assumed d20 roll of 8.  Thus, a character’s ‘Passive Perception’ check would be 8 + WIS bonus.

It is helpful to have the following passive checks written down ahead of time:  **Perception**, **Insight** and each **Saving Throw**.

### Saving Throws
Saving throws are a specialized type of **D20 Check**.  The saving throw modifier is applied to the d20 roll along with an appropriate ability modifier.  
- Evasion saving throws add the highest of the character’s Dexterity or Intelligence modifiers
- Hardiness uses Strength or Constitution
- Spirit uses either Wisdom or Charisma

Unlike other D20 Checks, a **natural 1** always results in a failure on a Saving Throw and a **natural 20** is always a success.

## Charisma and Reactions
A **Reaction Check** is made upon the PCs meeting an NPC or group of NPCs for the first time and how they may react is uncertain.  Unlike other D20 Checks, this is not a simple pass/fail test.  Instead the D20 is rolled and the spokesperson's **Charisma Modifier** is added to the roll.  If the NPC group is inclined to be hostile, the roll is made with **Dissadvantage**.  If they are already inclined to be friendly, the roll is made with **Advantage**.  Most groups are neutral and will simply be a standard roll.  Compare the total rolled to the table below.

### Reaction Check Result Table
| d20      | Result |
|:---------|:-------|
| 1-       | **Hostile:** Will either attack or otherwise attempt to thwart the PC. If hostile action is not possible or obvious suicide, will attempt -to flee or get help. |
| 2 to 6   | **Unfriendly:** Will either attack or otherwise thwart the PCs if the NPCs have the upper hand. Otherwise will watch the PCs warily to see what they do. |
| 7 to 14  | **Neutral:** The NPCs are undecided and will keep a watch on what the PCs do before deciding on their own course of action. |
| 15 to 19 | **Indifferent:** Open to friendly negotiation or simply going about one another’s business unmolested. |
| 20+      | **Friendly:** Willing to cooperate with the PCs and even provide assistance if such is not dangerous or too costly. |
