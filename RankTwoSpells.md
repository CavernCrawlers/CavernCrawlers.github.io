If contact is maintained for a full minute and a second saving throw is failed, deeper thoughts may be detected.  To detect subconscious thoughts (and thus detect the thoughts of [Unconscious](Combat.md#Unconscious) creatures) requires a full 10 minutes of contact.

This spell creates a convincing visual and audio illusion from the caster's imagination.

Other creatures can see through the illusion with a Spirit save upon first viewing it or when witnessing the illusion do anything they believe would be impossible.  Additionally, any creature physically touching the illusion will automatically recognize it for what it really is.

*Increased Ranks*
Each +1 Rank may be used to do any one of the following:

Escaping the web requires a STR check vs the spell's DT.  The webbing may also be burned away, taking 2d4(pool) rounds, but those caught in the web will take 1d4 nonmagical fire damage for each round the web burns.
