If the target fails their save, the caster is able to "hear" and understand the creature's surface thoughts even if they do not share a language.  If contact is maintained for a full minute and a second saving through is failed, deeper thoughts may be detected.  To detect subconscious thoughts (and thus detect the thoughts of [Unconscious](Combat.md#Unconscious) creatures) requires a full 10 minutes of contact.

Choosing to hold on to the object, or wearing an affected object, causes the holder to take 1d6 Fire damage and pass a Hardiness save or drop the item (or drop prone for worn objects).  This effect occurs once per round on the caster's turn until the duration expires or concentration is broken.

The number of objects effected may be increased by +1 per +1 Rank.

**Duration:** 1 hour<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
This spell allows the caster to sense the direction, but not distance, of an object.  The object can be of a general type (such as a staircase, alter, wooden barrel, etc).  In this case, the nearest qualifying object is located.  Alternatively, a specific object that the caster is already familiar with may be specified, in which case it is that specific object that is located if it is within range.

## Mirror Image
**Tier:** 2 (6+)<br/>

**Range:** Personal<br/>
**Area:** Self<br/>
**Duration:** 1 hour<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
This spell creates 1d3+1 illusory images of the caster in the same space.  All the duplicate images copy all of the caster's actions and are impossible to tell apart by natural means.  Any attacks against the caster are performed with **Disadvantage**.  If one die would have hit the caster but the other does not, one of the images is hit and disappears.  Once all images have disappeared or the spell's duration expires, the spell ends.

The duration of the spell may be increased 1 step per +1 Rank.

## Phantasm
**Tier:** 2 (6+)<br/>
**Runes:** Illusion<br/>
**Casting Ability:** Intelligence<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** Medium<br/>
**Duration:** 10 min (c)<br/>
**Save:** Spirit (12+)<br/>
This spell creates a convincing visual and audio illusion from the caster's imagination. The illusion can be no larger than a medium-sized creature and can be made to move about and make noise so long as it remains within the spell's range.  Other creatures can see through the illusion with a Spirit save upon first viewing it or when witnessing the illusion do anything they believe would be impossible.  Additionally, any creature physically touching the illusion will automatically recognize it for what it really is.

By increasing the spell's rank to 4, the illusion may be used to cause damage to any creature that it attacks who believes it is real.  Such attacks require a ranged Magical Attack roll from the caster and do 1d8 + Intelligence Modifier spirit damage.  Additionally, touching the illusion does not automatically reveal its true nature.

The spell's range may be increased by 1 increment (though not beyond Sight) for +1 Rank.  

The spell's area of effect may be increased 1 step for each +1 Rank.  

Finally, the spell's duration may instead be increased 1 step for each +1 Rank.

Increasing the rank of this spell may increase the range to Far for +1 Rank.

The spell's duration may be increased 1 step per +1 Rank.

Escaping the web requires a STR check vs the spell's DT.  The webbing may also be burned away, taking 2d4(pool) rounds, but those caught in the web will take 1d4 fire damage for each round the web burns.
