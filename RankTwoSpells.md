## Knowing
**Casting Ability:** Wisdom<br/>
**Casting Time:** 10 minutes<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** 1 Creature or Object<br/>
**Duration:** instant<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
This spell reveals the nature of the target to the caster.  If the target is a creature, the caster learns one specific aspect of the target: creature type, hit dice, resistances, immunities, allegiances, morality or vulnerabilities.  If the target is an object, the caster gains magical knowledge of who created the item, famous owners and the general lore and history of the item and its abilities (if any).

**Area:** Self<br/>
**Duration:** 10 minutes<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
For the duration of the spell, the caster can detect the presence and location of any invisible creatures or objects within near range and line of sight.  This allows the caster to know their location and make attacks normally, but details are hazy and indistinct.

Casting this spell at rank 3 removes the haziness.

The duration of the spell may be doubled per +1 rank.

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes<br/>
**Range:** Personal<br/>
**Area:** Self<br/>
**Duration:** 1 hour<br/>
**Save:** Spirit<br/>
For the duration of this spell, the caster can touch a creature and attempt to read its thoughts.  The touch must be skin-to-skin and the target is allowed a Spirit saving throw to resist the effect.  If the target fails their save, the caster is able to "hear" and understand the creatures surface thoughts even if they do not share a language.  If contact is maintained for a full minute and a second saving through is failed, deeper throughs may be detected.  To detect subconscious thoughts (and thus detect the thoughts of [Unconscious](Combat.md#Unconscious) creatures) requires a full 10 minutes of contact.

## Elemental Arrow
**Casting Ability:** Intelligence<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 Action<br/>
**Range:** Far<br/>
**Area:** 1 Creature<br/>
**Duration:** 2d4(pool) rounds (c)<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
The caster conjures an arrow of elemental energy (acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, spirit, radiant or thunder), whose type is determined when the spell is learned.  This spell may be learned multiple times to add additional elemental types; each counting as a separate spell.  When the spell is cast, the mage must specify the type of energy being used for the attack.  Once cast, the spellcaster makes a **Magical Attack** roll vs the target's **AC**.  On a successful hit, the spell does 1d6+2 damage of the given energy type.  On the target's successive turns they will take an additional 1d4 damage until either the duration expires or they pass a **Hardiness** saving throw.

The attack's damage may be increased by +2 damage per +1 Rank.

## Heat Metal
**Casting Ability:** Wisdom<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** 1 Object<br/>
**Duration:** 2d4(pool) rounds (c)<br/>
**Save:** Hardiness<br/>
This spell causes a single non-living metal object to glow red hot, potentially burning anyone touching it.  The targeted object can have an encumbrance value no greater than 3.  Anyone holding the object can release it in order to avoid taking damage.  Choosing to hold on to the object, or wearing an affected object, causes the holder to take 1d6 Fire damage and pass a Hardiness save or drop the item (or drop prone for worn objects).  This effect occurs once per round on the caster's turn until the duration expires or concentration is broken.

## Invisibility
**Casting Ability:** Intelligence<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 minute<br/>
**Range:** Touch<br/>
**Area:** 1 Creature or Object<br/>
**Duration:** 10 minutes<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
This spell renders the touched creature or object invisible for the spell's duration.  Any gear a targeted creature is wearing/carrying is also rendered invisible.  If an invisible creature attempts any hostile action on another creature, the spell is immediately broken.

Increasing the Rank of this spell increases the number of affected creatures by +1 per +1 Rank.  Increasing the rank may also double the duration per +1 Rank.

## Locate
**Casting Ability:** Intelligence<br/>
**Casting Time:** 10 minutes<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** 1 Object<br/>
**Duration:** 1 hour<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
This spell allows the caster to sense the direction, but not distance, of an object.  The object can be of a general type (such as a staircase, alter, wooden barrel, etc).  In this case, the nearest qualifying object is located.  Alternatively, a specific object that the caster is already familiar with may be specified, in which case it is that specific object that is located if it is within range.

By increasing the spell to Rank 3, the caster can also locate creatures in the same manner as above.  However, if a specific creature is targeted, it is allowed a Spirit saving throw to resist the spell.

The spells range may be increased 1 step per +1 Rank.  The spell's duration may be doubled per +1 Rank.

## Mirror Image
**Casting Ability:** Intelligence<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Personal<br/>
**Area:** Self<br/>
**Duration:** 1 hour<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
This spell creates 1d4 illusory images of the caster in the same space.  All the duplicate images copy all of the caster's actions and are impossible to tell apart by natural means.  Any attacks against the caster are performed with **Disadvantage**.  If one die would have hit the caster but the other does not, one of the images is hit and disappears.  Once all images have disappeared or the spell's duration expires, the spell ends.

The duration of the spell may be doubled per +1 Rank.

## Phantasm
**Casting Ability:** Intelligence<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** Medium<br/>
**Duration:** 10 min (c)<br/>
**Save:** Spirit<br/>
This spell creates a convincing visual and audio illusion from the caster's imagination. The illusion can be no larger than a medium-sized creature and can be made to move about and make noise so long as it remains within the spell's range.  Other creatures can see through the illusion with a Spirit save upon first viewing it or when witnessing the illusion do anything they believe would be impossible.  Additionally, any creature physically touching the illusion will recognize it for what it really is.

By increasing the spell's rank to 4, the illusion may be used to cause damage to any creature that it attacks who believes it is real.  Such attacks require a ranged Magical Attack roll from the caster and do 1d8 + Intelligence Modifier spirit damage.

The spells range may be increased by 1 increment (though not beyond Sight) for +1 Rank.  Alternatively, the spell's area of effect may be doubled for each +1 Rank.  Finally, the spell's duration may instead be doubled for each +1 Rank.

## Silence
**Casting Ability:** Wisdom<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** Medium<br/>
**Duration:** 1 minute<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
No sound can enter, exit or pass through the targeted area for the duration of the spell.  Creatures in the area are immediately [Deafened](Combat.md#Deafened) while in the area and do not make any noise of any kind.  This will prevent spellcasters from being able to speak, and thus unable to cast their spells.

Increasing the rank of this spell can either increase the range to Far for +1 Rank or double the area of effect per +1 Rank.

## Smite
**Casting Ability:** Wisdom<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** 1 Object<br/>
**Duration:** 1 minute (c)<br/>
**Save:** none<br/>
Upon casting this spell, a single weapon of the caster's choice within range becomes suffused with elemental energy (acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, spirit, radiant or thunder), whose type is determined when the spell is learned.  This spell may be learned multiple times to add additional elemental types; each counting as a separate spell.  When the spell is cast, the mage must specify the type of energy being infused into the weapon.  Upon that weapon's next successful hit, it does an additional 1d6 damage of the given energy type and counts as magical for the purposes of immunity and resistance.  Once a successful hit is scored, or upon the completion of the spell's duration if no hit is scored, the spell ends.

The number of weapons enchanted may be increased by +1 per +1 Rank.  The elemental damage die may be increased 1 step per +1 Rank.

## Warp Wood
**Casting Ability:** Wisdom<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** 1 Object<br/>
**Duration:** instant<br/>
**Save:** none (Evasion)<br/>
This spell causes up to 2 encumbrance of wood to warp, bend and twist.  Any weapons or armor targeted become useless.  This spell can cause tree branches to entangle a target if they fail an Evasion save.  Once entangled, the creature gains the [Grappled](Combat.md#Grappled) condition.  The creature may free itself by passing a Strength check vs the spell's DT.

## Web
**Casting Ability:** Intelligence<br/>
**Casting Time:** 1 action<br/>
**Range:** Near<br/>
**Area:** Large<br/>
**Duration:** 1 hour<br/>
**Save:** Evasion<br/>
This spell conjures a gigantic web of thick, clinging strands of webbing as if woven by a gigantic spider.  Any creatures in or attempting to pass through the area of effect must pass an Evasion save or become stuck in the web and gains the [Grappled](Combat.md#Grappled) condition.  Escaping the web requires a STR check vs the spell's DT.  The webbing may also be burned away, taking 2d4(pool) rounds, but those caught in the web will take 1d6 fire damage for each round the web burns.

The spell's range may be increased to Far for +1 Rank.  The area of effect may be doubled for each +1 Rank.
