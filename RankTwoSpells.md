Choosing to hold on to the object, or wearing an affected object, causes the holder to take 1d6 Fire damage and they must pass a Hardiness save or drop the item (or drop prone for worn objects).

Other creatures can see through the illusion with a Spirit save upon first viewing it or when witnessing the illusion do anything they believe would be impossible.  Additionally, any creature physically touching the illusion will automatically recognize it for what it really is.

*Increased Ranks*

Escaping the web requires a STR check vs the spell's save difficulty.
