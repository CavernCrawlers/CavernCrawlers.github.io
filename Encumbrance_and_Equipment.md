# Encumbrance

Any given character can only carry so much.  Some tables may wish to handwave the tracking of encumbrance and that's completely understandable.  The rules here are meant to provide some degree of verisimilitude without having to track pounds and ounces of carried gear and treasure.

Encumbrance is tracked in **Items** or **Slots** (the terms are used interchangeably in these rules).  A single Item is any object that can be carried in one hand reasonably comfortably (a sword, a torch, a lute, etc).  Larger objects requiring two hands (such as great swords), take up at least 2 Slots (or more for even larger objects; like a full treasure chest).  Worn clothing does not count as an Item, but carried clothing does.  Small items (such as coins) do not count as an Item unless they are carried in bulk (such as 100 coins counting as 1 Item). 

Additionally, some equipment may be bundled to reduce the number of Slots it takes up (such as a bundle of 7 Rations only taking up 3 Slots).  These bundles require an Action to break apart for use after which the individual objects making up the bundle must be tracked separately.

Each character may carry a number of **Readied Items** equal to half their **Strength Score**, rounded up.  Readied Items are those items on hand for immediate use and may be used without needing to take an **Action** to unsheathe or unpack them.  This includes things like worn armor, carried shields and weapons and any other item the character wishes to be able to access quickly an easily.

**Stowed Items** are those packed away and carefully organized to be as compact as possible.  To carry any Stowed Items, a character must have a backpack, sack or similar thing in which to carry these items.  If so equipped, a character can carry as many Stowed Items as their **Strength Score**.

These limits represent the amount of gear a character can carry without penalty.  An extra 2 **Readied Items** or 4 **Stowed Items** (or fractions thereof), reduces a character's **Movement** by 5 feet and they take a -2 penalty on all **Strength** and **Dexterity Checks**.  Additionally, for every hour so encumbered, they must make a **Constitution Check** vs a **Difficulty** of 13 or gain a level of **Exhaustion**.  Going further beyond this limit; up to 4 Readied Items or 8 Stowed Items, reduces the character's movement to half, causes **Disadvantage** on Strength and Dexterity checks and increases the Exhaustion check difficulty to 15.

# Coinage
Every petty king and warlord seems to issue their own form of currency.  Below is a table listing those coin types most commonly found (along with sample regional names for the coins).  Most peasants and commoners deal in barter, but whey they do have coin, it is typically copper or (occasionally) silver.  Silver is typically the coin of the merchant class. Higher value coins are rarely seen by the peasantry, but are in general circulation among wealthy merchants and nobles.

Even rarer still are ancient coins, gems, jewelry and the like.  Their value varies greatly by their rarity and quality.

The entries on the coinage table are far from the only materials used for money.  Some regions may use wood, bone, ivory or even more unusual materials.  Exchanges between countries is a matter of material value and diplomatic relations.

| Coin | Abbreviation | Name* | Value | Real World Equivalent |
|:-----|:------------:|:-----:|------:|----------------------:|
| Copper | cp | "Peasant" | 1/10sp | $1.00 |
| Silver | sp | "Common" | 1sp | $10.00 |
| Electrum | ep | "Knight" | 5sp | $50.00 |
| Gold | gp | "Noble" | 10sp | $100.00 |
| Platinum | pp | "Royal" | 100sp | $1,000.00 |

# Equipment

## Quality
Below are tables of various weapons, goods, services and the like, giving the typical price for each.  Price, however, often varies by quality.  The exact game effect of different quality items is often left up to the GM to determine on a case-by-case basis.  For example, a poor quality sword may be judged to have a -1 to hit chance, while a superior quality sword may increase it’s damage die by 1 step.  It is recommended that weapon quality modifiers be limited to no more than +/- 1 on to-hit or damage, or a 1 die step for damage.  Higher quality weapons might have multiple such properties (such as a master-crafted bow being +1 to hit, +1 die step damage and +10% range).

| Quality | Cost Multiplier |
|:--------|:---------------:|
| Poor | 0.5 |
| Common | 1 |
| Excellent | 2 |
| Superior | 4 |
| Master/Luxury | 10 |

## Rarity
Not all items are equally available in all regions.  As a result, the GM is encouraged to multiply the cost of an item based on how common or rare it is.  The recommended range is the same as for Quality Modifiers above (x0.5 to x10).

## Haggling
It is possible that your players may wish to haggle with local merchants over the cost of items (especially for those with quality or rarity modifiers).  This can be handled with a simple roll on the Reaction Table (see Rolling the Dice) modified by the bartering character’s CHA Modifier and Persuasion (or other appropriate) skill.  Below are some suggestions on how to interpret the results:

| Reaction Check Result | Effect |
|:---|:---|
| Hostile | The merchant is insulted and throws the character out of the shop.  If they have any influence in the community, they may consider blacklisting the character with other merchants. |
| Unfriendly | The merchant not only refuses to haggle, but increases the price by (1d4+1)x10%. |
| Neutral | The merchant is potentially willing to make a compromise deal, changing their price by (2d4-5)x5% [-15% to +15%] |
| Indifferent | The merchant agrees to reduce their price by up to 30%. |
| Friendly | The character has won the merchant over to such a degree that they’re willing to offer a ‘friends and family’ discount, cutting their price by up to 50%. |

If the characters have no intent to haggle, simply forego any haggling rolls and use the price as listed (modified by quality and rarity as normal).
