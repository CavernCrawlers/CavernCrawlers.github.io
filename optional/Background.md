## Background Career
Everyone did something before they became an adventurer. Roll (1d100) or select from the [Background Career Table](#background%20career%20table) to determine what it was your character did before being thrust into a life of adventure. This will determine some of your character's starting equipment.  Your character is automatically proficient with any weapon provided by their background occupation, but not the entire [weapon weight class](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#weight).

---
## Using Background Careers
Your character is automatically considered [skilled](RulesSynopsis.md#skilled%20check) with any activities related to their background career, the same as they are for their class.

## Background Career Table
