# Elf
**AKA**: Alfar, Aelph, Erle, Olve, Shee<br/>
Elves are as much of the Fey world as they are of the mortal realm.  While this has granted them many advantages, such as a long life (typically living to be 750 years or more and not considered adults until after their first century has passed) and a greater capacity for resisting baleful magics, it also makes them seem among the most alien of all the common species.  They are slender in build and typically range between 5 and 6 feet in height.
