They typically mature at the same rate as humans, but are considered young until around the age of 50, as they typically live for 350 years.

## Features
### Dust of Ages
The age of the dwarf is long since past. A Dwarf’s Base and Max **Fortune Points** are reduced by 1 (to a minimum 1 **Max Fortune**).
### Enduring as Stone
Dwarves have endurance beyond that of humans.  They gain +1 HP per level and roll **Hit Dice** with **Advantage** when resting and healing.
### Fortitude of Iron
Dwarves have a permanent +2 bonus on their **Hardiness Saves**.
### Low-Light Vision
Dwarves see in dim light nearly as well as full daylight; however, this vision is shades of gray only, so color cannot be discerned in these conditions.  Also, this ability does not function in full darkness.
### True Name
As creatures of rock and stone, old as the earth, dwarves have **True Names**, and those with that knowledge may use a dwarf’s name against him. By calling out the name, a character gains **Advantage** on all actions taken against the dwarf, including **attacks** and **saving throws**.

## Optional
