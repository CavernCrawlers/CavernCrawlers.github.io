## Class Abilities

### Exhausting Magic
If you fail an **Invocation** check, you may increase the check total by +3 per level of **Exhaustion** gained.

### Highly Skilled
Rogue-Mages receive 3 skills at first level instead of 2.  They gain an additional skill at level 3 and every 3 levels thereafter.  Instead of gaining a new skill, they may get better at one which they already have, increasing the bonus for that skill to +6.

### Magical Focus
As part of your apprenticeship, you created a unique magical focus to aid in your spellcasting.  This focus may take most any form (a staff, wand, amulet or similar), but must be easily seen, recognized and hand-held.  If you attempt to cast a spell without your focus in hand, you do so with **Disadvantage** on the **Invocation** roll.  A focus may be replaced by constructing a new one which takes 1 week in a **Safe Haven** and 50sp worth of materials.

### Magic User
You can harness the power of magic with **Cantrips**, **Spells** or **Rituals** (collectively known as **Magical Arts**).  As a partial caster, you can cast cantrips and one other of magical art (spells or rituals).  A rogue-mage begins their career knowing two cantrips and either two spells or a single ritual.  You will need to select a **Magical Tradition** from which your magical arts will be drawn.

### Sense Magic
Being naturally sensitive to the world of magic, you may determine if a person, place or thing is magical with a **Perception** check.  Doing so requires concentration and a few minutes; so you cannot tell if something is magical simply by being in its presence and people tend to notice when a mage is staring at them.  You can also attempt to decipher magical writing with an **Intelligence** check.

### True Name
As a magic-user possessing supernatural power, you have a **True Name**.  Those who know your True Name can use it against you.  By calling out your True Name, a creature gains **Advantage** on all actions taken against you, including attacks and you have **Disadvantage** on your **Invocation** checks to cast spells against them.
