## Generating Ability Scores
Multiple methods of generating ability scores are offered here.  It is suggested that all players use the same method.

### Playing Cards
First, decide upon the power level you wish for the PCs in your campaign: Gritty, Heroic or Epic.

For **Gritty** character creation, each player constructs a deck of standard playing cards with 3 cards each of Ace through Six.  Shuffle the cards and deal them out in six piles of three cards each.  Total the values of the cards (counting Ace as '1') in each pile and assign those scores to your character's **Attributes** as desired.  This will generate a character with a total of 63 attribute points; or an average of 10.5 per attribute.

For **Heroic** character creation, use the same method as described under Gritty, but use only 2 cards each of Ace through three and 4 cards each of four through six.  This generates a character with a total of 72 attribute points; or an average of 12 per attribute.

For **Epic** character creation, build the deck from 1 two, 2 threes, 4 fives, 3 sixes and 4 sevens.  This will give a total of 78 character points; or an average of 13 per attribute.

### Random Rolls
Roll 3d6 three times and record the results.  Next take those three rolls and subtract each from 21.  This will give you an array of 6 rolls totalling 63 points (averaging out to 10.5 each).  Arrange the scores as desired.

For **Heroic** character creation, proceed as above then divide 9 points among your abilities, increasing no ability by more than 3 and no higher than 18.

For **Epic** character creation, divde 15 points among your abilities, increasing no ability higher than 18.

### BARFLIP
The BARFLIP method is described [here](https://planarian.itch.io/barflip-gridflip).  It is recommended for groups that prefer to use dice over cards but still want all characters to be relatively balanced.  Note that this method will generate characters with a total of 78 ability points; or an average of 13 per attribute.

### Ability Array
After the group determines the power level of the game, each player selects a column from the appropriate table below to get an array for their character.  Place each value in the ability score of your choosing.  Each value in an array must be used once.

#### Gritty Arrays
|  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |  E  |  F  |  G  |  H  |  I  |  J  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  14 |  16 |  14 |  13 |  16 |  18 |  18 |  18 |  13 |  16 |
|  12 |  12 |  13 |  13 |  12 |  10 |  12 |  12 |  13 |  14 |
|  10 |  10 |  10 |  10 |  10 |   9 |  10 |   9 |  13 |  12 |
|  10 |   9 |  10 |  10 |   9 |   9 |   9 |   8 |   8 |   7 |
|   9 |   8 |   9 |   9 |   8 |   9 |   8 |   8 |   8 |   7 |
|   8 |   8 |   8 |   8 |   8 |   8 |   6 |   8 |   8 |   7 |

Each column on this table adds up to 63 points (10.5 per ability).

#### Heroic Arrays
| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 15 | 16 | 14 |  14 | 16 | 18 | 18 | 18 | 16 | 18 |
| 14 | 14 | 14 |  14 | 14 | 12 | 14 | 14 | 16 | 16 |
| 13 | 12 | 12 |  14 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 16 | 14 |
| 12 | 10 | 12 |  12 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 10 |  8 |  8 |
| 10 | 10 | 10 |  10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 |  8 |  8 |
|  8 | 10 | 10 |   8 |  8 |  8 |  6 |  8 |  8 |  8 |

Each column on this table adds up to 72 points (12 per ability).

#### Epic Arrays
|  A  |  B  |   C |  D  |   E |   F |   G |   H |   I |   J |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  16 |  16 |  18 |  16 |  16 |  18 |  18 |  18 |  18 |  18 |
|  16 |  16 |  16 |  16 |  14 |  16 |  18 |  18 |  16 |  18 |
|  13 |  16 |  13 |  14 |  13 |  13 |  16 |  18 |  16 |  13 |
|  13 |  13 |  13 |  13 |  13 |  13 |  10 |   8 |  10 |  13 |
|  10 |   9 |   9 |  10 |  13 |   9 |   8 |   8 |   9 |   8 |
|  10 |   8 |   9 |   9 |   9 |   9 |   8 |   9 |   9 |   8 |

Each column on this table adds up to 78 points (13 per ability).

### The Attributes
#### Strength
The measure of a character’s raw physical power.  This is used in feats of might, such as lifting a heavy boulder or smashing open a locked door.  A character’s raw Strength score is also their [Stowed Encumbrance](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#encumbrance) limit and half this score is their [Ready Encumbrance](EncumbranceAndEquipment.md#encumbrance) limit.

#### Dexterity
This is a character’s overall agility, coordination and reflexes.  It is used in feats of acrobatics, hand-eye coordination and to avoid effects that could be dodged.  The raw score is used as the character's base [Initiative](Combat.md#initiative) rating (plus a modifier based on class and level).

#### Constitution
This is measures a character’s toughness, endurance and overall health.  It is used to resist the negative effects of poisons, diseases and other physical ailments.  The raw score is also used for recovering from injuries after a [Long Rest](Combat.md#healing%20and%20recovery).

#### Intelligence
Intelligence is a character’s quickness of mind and understanding.  Those with high intelligence scores are quickly able to work out puzzles, recognize patterns and recall past information.  The raw score is used to . . .

#### Wisdom
This is a character’s strength of will, conviction and spiritual health.  It is used to resist negative mental effects such as possession, mind control, hypnosis, fear and trauma.  The raw score determines . . .

#### Charisma
This is a character’s force of personality and social influence.  Characters with high charisma scores are natural leaders, good at navigating social situations and are readily believed and trusted by strangers.  A character’s raw Charisma score is the maximum number of [Hirelings](HirelingsAndAllies.md) they can directly control.

### Attribute Modifiers
Each attribute also has an **Attribute Modifier** that is used as a bonus (or penalty) to the D20 roll on any **Ability Check** for that ability.  Use the table below to determine each of your **Ability Score's** modifiers.

|  Score             |  Modifier  |
|:------------------:|:----------:|
|   3<sup>*</sup>    |        -3  |
|              4-5   |        -2  |
|              6-8   |        -1  |
|             9-12   |        +0  |
|             13-15  |        +1  |
|             16-17  |        +2  |
|   18<sup>%</sup>   |        +3  |  

<sub>
* Scores below 3 are only possible through supernatural effects or physical trauma.<br/>
% Scores above 18 are only possible through supernatural effects.
</sub>

## Pick a Species
In fantasy gaming there are a practically limitless number of possible species to choose from.  The list presented in these pages is just a small sample of possible species and your GM may have their own list specific to their campaign world.

There are several species to choose from: [Dwarf](species/Dwarf.md), [Elf](species/Elf.md), [Goblin](species/Goblin.md), [Hob](species/Hob.md), [Human](species/Human.md) and [Orc](species/Orc.md).

---
## Roll for Background Career
Roll on the [Background Career](Background.md#background%20career%20table) table to determine what your character did before becoming an adventurer.

---
## Pick a Class
There are six character [classes](classes/Classes.md): [Fighter](classes/Fighter.md), [Rogue](classes/Rogue.md), [Spellcaster](classes/Spellcaster.md), [Fighter-Rogue](classes/Fighter-Rogue.md), [Fighter-Spellcaster](classes/Fighter-Spellcaster.md) and [Rogue-Spellcaster](classes/Rogue-Spellcaster.md).

---
## Pick a Trait
All characters start with 1 [Trait](Traits.md) at level 1.  They will gain additional [Traits](Traits.md) at various levels.

---
## Pick Languages
Most characters begin the game speaking two languages (their native language and a "common" tongue).  To this, add a number of additional languages equal to your character’s **Intelligence Modifier** (though this cannot take you down to less than 1 starting language).  Additionally, most characters are illiterate by default.  One language pick may be spent for a character to become literate.  Once literate, a character is considered literate in all languages they know.

---
## Calculate Starting Hit Points
Each character's starting **HP** is the maximum rolled on their class **Hit Die** plus their **Constitution Modifier**.

---
## Choose Starting Equipment
Each [Class](Classes.md) and [Background](Background.md) grants starting equipment and a few extra Silver Pieces.  You may use this starting silver to purchase additional equipment if so desired.  Starting equipment may be sold off at half it's base value (due to being worn and used).

---
## Calculate Armor Class and Saving Throws
Calculate your character's **Armor Class** (based on armor worn and **Dexterity Modifier**), **Evasion Saving Throw** (based on **Class** and the higher of your character's **Dexterity** and **Intelligence Modifiers**), **Hardiness Saving Throw** (based on Class and the higher of your character's **Strength** and **Constitution Modifiers**) and **Spirit Saving Throw** (based on Class and the higher of your character's **Wisdom** and **Charisma Modifiers**).

Additionally, each of your **Saving Throws** will have a **Passive Save** value equal to 8 plus your Saving Throw (with appropriate **Ability Modifier**).

_For example:  Bron the Brave is a 3rd level [Fighter](classes/Fighter.md) with 14 STR, 12 CON, 10 DEX, 8 INT, 9 WIS and 10 CHA, who wears Ringmail armor and carries a shield.  His Armor Class is 10 + 3 (Ringmail) + 2 (Shield) = 15.  His Evasion Save is +2 (class) + 0 (DEX is higher than INT) = +2.  His Hardiness Save is +3 (class) + 1 (STR is higher than CON) = +4.  His Spirit Save is +1 (class) +0 (CHA is higher than WIS) = +1.  His Passive Saves are 10, 12 and 9 respectively._

---
## Passions
Passions describe the things that are important to your character and can be both positive and negative.  Each character should have between 3 and 5 **Passions**, as determined by the player and approved by the GM.  A Passion should be describable in a single sentence or short phrase; if it takes more than a single line to describe a Passion, it is too complex and should be broken down into multiple Passions.  One tip is to phrase your passions in the manner of "I want. . .", "I will. . ." or "I won't. . .".

Some examples of appropriate Passions are:
- I will protect my family at all costs.
- I will never break the tenants of the Chivalric Code.
- I will not lie.
- I want to help those less fortunate than I.
- I venerate the gods and wish to promote their worship to all.

Some examples of inappropriate Passions:
- Has an honest face.  {Not really a personality trait and doesn’t have a negative connotation.}
- Kleptomaniac {Doesn’t have a positive connotation.}
- Blind in one eye. {Physical trait, not a personality trait.}
- Crazy {Too broad.}
- Lawful Good {Not well defined and covers two aspects of personality instead of one.}

---
## Pick a Name, Goal and Ties
The final steps are to give your character a thematically appropriate name, at least one short and one long-term goal (ideally related to their [Passions](#passions)) and a reason why it is they're willing to risk their life along side these other adventurers.

Goals should be something that the character is potentially willing to die for rather than stay at home living a comfy life.  Also, make sure it isn't something that will interfere with the fun of the rest of the group.

Your character's ties to the rest of the group doesn't mean that everyone has to like each other and always get along.  However, it does mean that, when the chips are down, you know they'll have your back and you'll have theirs.
