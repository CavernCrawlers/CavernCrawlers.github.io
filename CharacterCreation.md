## Generating Ability Scores
Multiple methods of generating ability scores are offered here.  It is suggested that all players use the same method.

### Playing Cards
First, decide upon the power level you wish for the PCs in your campaign: Gritty, Heroic or Epic.

For **Gritty** character creation, each player constructs a deck of standard playing cards with 3 cards each of Ace through Six.  Shuffle the cards and deal them out in six piles of three cards each.  Total the values of the cards (counting Ace as '1') in each pile and assign those scores to your character's **Attributes** as desired.  This will generate a character with a total of 63 attribute points; or an average of 10.5 per attribute.

For **Heroic** character creation, use the same method as described under Gritty, but use only 2 cards each of Ace through three and 4 cards each of four through six.  This generates a character with a total of 72 attribute points; or an average of 12 per attribute.

For **Epic** character creation, build the deck from 1 two, 2 threes, 4 fives, 3 sixes and 4 sevens.  This will give a total of 78 character points; or an average of 13 per attribute.

### BARFLIP
The BARFLIP method is described [here](https://planarian.itch.io/barflip-gridflip).  It is recommended for groups that prefer to use dice over cards but still want all characters to be relatively balanced.  Note that this method will generate characters with a total of 78 ability points; or an average of 13 per attribute.

### Ability Array
After the group determines the power level of the game, each player selects a column from the appropriate table below to get an array for their character.  Place each value in the ability score of your choosing.  Each value in an array must be used once.

#### Gritty Arrays
|  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |  E  |  F  |  G  |  H  |  I  |  J  |

## Pick a Species
In fantasy gaming there are a practically limitless number of possible species to choose from.  The list presented in these pages is just a small sample of possible species and your GM may have their own list specific to their campaign world.

### Dwarf
**AKA**: Dweorg, Dyerven, Gnome, Svartal
Dwarves are a stocky species averaging around 4 to 5 feet in height, yet weighing as much as a full grown human.  Both men and women are capable of growing beards, though some choose to shave.  They typically mature at the same rate as humans, but are considered young until around the age of 50, as they typically live for 350 years.
- Starting Age: 30 + 2d10 years
- Height: 47 + 2d6 inches (4' 1" to 4' 11")

##### Fortitude of Iron
Dwarves have a permanent +2 bonus on their **Hardiness Defense**.

##### True Name
As creatures of rock and stone, old as the earth, dwarves have **True Names**, and those with that knowledge may use a dwarf’s name against him. By calling out the name, a character gains **Advantage** on all actions taken against the dwarf, including attacking him.

### Elf
**AKA**: Alfar, Aelph, Erle, Olve, Shee
Elves are as much of the Fey world as they are of the mortal realm.  While this has granted them many advantages, such as a long life (typically living to be 750 years or more and not considered adults until after their first century has passed) and a greater capacity for resisting baleful magics, it also makes them seem among the most alien of all the common species.  They are slender in build and typically range between 5 and 6 feet in height.

- Height: 52 + 2d10 inches (4' 6" to 6')

### Hob
**AKA**: Hin, Hobniz, Pech, Puck, Smallfolk, Halfling
Aside from their height, slightly pointed ears and thick-soled hairy feet, hobs seem to be the most similar to humans among the great variety of species.  Even their own ethnicities seem to follow the same patterns as those of humans.  They are most frequently found living among humans, though also occasionally among elves, dwarves and other cultures.  There do exist, however, a handful of hob-centric towns, villages and nomadic troupes scattered around the many kingdoms.

Hobs mature at the same rate as humans but live slightly longer, some reaching as much as 120 years.  However, they are among the smallest of species, typically averaging between 3 and 4 feet in height and 30 to 60 pounds.
- Starting Age: 20 + 3d6 years
- Height: 25 + 2d6 inches (3' 1" to 3' 11")

### Orc
**AKA**: Bugbear, Euroz, Krork, Orteh
Orcs are a physically powerful race slightly taller than humans but much stockier and more muscled.  Their features are superficially similar to those of Goblins, causing some to believe that the species are related but neither Orcs nor Goblins consider this to be true.  Additionally, while both have similar skin tones, lack of hair and pointed ears, Orc teeth are less sharp with a pair of tusks protruding from their lower jaws.  The orcish lifespan is slightly less than that of a human, typically maturing around age 15 and living around 65 years.

## Pick a Class
There are six character classes: [Warrior](Warrior.md), [Rogue](Rogue.md), [Mage](Mage.md), [Warrior-Rogue](Warrior-Rogue.md), [Warrior-Mage](Warrior-Mage.md) and [Rogue-Mage](Rogue-Mage.md).

## Pick Skills
Give your character 2 skills from the [Skill List](Skills.md) (or more if a rogue / partial-rogue).

Having a skill gives your character a +4 to their **Ability Checks**.  Taking the same skill a second time, increases this bonus to +6.

In addition to your starting skills, your character will gain an additional skill at various levels as indicated in your class’s description.

## Pick Languages
Most characters begin the game speaking two languages (their native language and a "common" tongue).  To this, add a number of additional languages equal to your character’s **Intelligence Bonus** (if it is positive).  Additionally, most characters are illiterate.  One language pick may be spent for a character to become literate.  Once literate, a character is considered literate in all languages they know.
